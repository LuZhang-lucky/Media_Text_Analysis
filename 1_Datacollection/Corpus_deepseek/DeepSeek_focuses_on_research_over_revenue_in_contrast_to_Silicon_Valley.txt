Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek is choosing to focus on research over chasing revenues, as its billionaire founder decides not to follow Silicon Valley rivals by taking advantage of a sudden jump in sales. The Hangzhou-based company, led by hedge fund billionaire Liang Wenfeng, has seen a surge for its services through its free website and app, but also from paid business clients. Last month, revenues were enough to cover ongoing costs for the first time, according to two people with knowledge of its development. Interest in DeepSeek has grown since January after the release of its low-cost R1 reasoning model which has comparable performance to US and Chinese competitors but built on a much smaller budget. Customers, mainly from sectors such as healthcare and finance, bought application programming interface, or API, access to DeepSeek’s R1 and V3 models, with demand so strong that the start-up had to suspend such services temporarily due to lack of resources it allocated to non-research purposes, according to the people. Industry insiders said Liang has shown little intention to capitalise on DeepSeek’s sudden fame to further commercialise its technology in the near term. The company is instead focusing the majority of its resources on model development and the quest to build artificial general intelligence — machines with humanlike cognitive capabilities. These people added the independently wealthy founder has also declined to entertain interest from China’s tech giants as well as venture and state-backed funds to invest in the group for the time being. Many have found it difficult to even arrange a meeting with the secluded founder. “We pulled top-level government connections and only got to sit down with someone from their finance department, who said ‘sorry we are not raising’,” said one investor at a multibillion-dollar Chinese tech fund. “They clearly are not interested in scaling up right now. It’s a rare situation where the founder is wealthy and committed enough to keep it lean in a Navy Seal-style for his pursuit of AGI.” 

DeepSeek’s emergence upset markets over doubts whether US tech groups such as Google and OpenAI could maintain their technical edge, as well as the wisdom of huge AI infrastructure spending plans of Big Tech groups. Its approach is also in significant contrast to many Silicon Valley start-ups. OpenAI has taken advantage of its early lead in AI model development to build a formidable consumer business around ChatGPT, generating significant revenues from selling its API. The San Francisco-based company has raised around $20bn in multiple rounds of financing since 2019, and is in talks with investors led by SoftBank to raise $40bn more at a valuation of $260bn. The company burned $5bn last year, much of that on training new models, and made about $4bn of revenue. It charges both corporate customers and individual consumers who use its various closed models. DeepSeek currently has about 160 employees, according to a person familiar with the matter. OpenAI has just over 2,000. “DeepSeek has been super focused from the beginning on the direction it’s going,” said Yusen Dai, a partner at venture capital Zhen Fund, who has invested in several Chinese AI start-ups. “It didn’t even have any consumer product until the launch of R1 [the company’s reasoning large language model]” said Dai in a Chinese podcast this week. DeepSeek’s lack of commercial ambition has helped tech companies such as Alibaba and Tencent to win over corporate clients in China with their more mature infrastructure and services, raising questions about whether the start-up’s revenue streams are sustainable. Apple, for example, chose Alibaba’s Qwen over DeepSeek to roll out AI functions on its iPhones in China later this year.

About half of its cloud clients, mainly from government and finance, have tried to use DeepSeek’s models and 20 per cent of them are requesting to customise their localised versions with Tencent’s support, they added. DeepSeek’s lack of focus on promoting its own mass-market product like OpenAI’s ChatGPT contributed to Tencent’s decision to embrace the start-up’s models, not only on its cloud platform but also on its popular consumer-facing applications, according to the person. Tencent declined to comment. Liang, a billionaire who founded one of China’s leading quants funds High Flyer, bought about 10,000 H800 and 10,000 A100 chips in the past few years, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The processors were obtained before they were later banned for China. Nvidia declined to comment.   DeepSeek will rely mainly on third-party providers for future demand exceeding their existing capacity, said the person with knowledge of the plans. DeepSeek has won support from Beijing, where the government is counting on AI to spur growth in its slowing economy. The start-up has gained access to state-funded data centres, easing its computing constraints. In the long run, DeepSeek may find limited access to Nvidia’s new generation of more advanced chips a potential bottleneck and consider future partnerships that can help solve this issue, according to industry insiders. It may also have to be open to state-backed funds at some point, to win further political support, they said. Engineers at the start-up are working full steam towards the release of their R2 and V4 models, which was initially scheduled for May but may be accelerated to keep its momentum going, said a person with knowledge of the move. “We are at the early stage of a revolution where the technology improvement curve is steep,” said Zhen Fund’s Dai. He added that companies should focus on breakthroughs instead of monetisation because “a high school student can’t make much money, while if you train him to become PhD, he can make a lot more.” DeepSeek did not respond to requests for comment.
