The Jevons Paradox is named after the 19th-century economist and logician William Stanley Jevons. In his 1865 book, “The Coal Question,” he noted that as engines improved and made coal more efficient — requiring less of the resource to produce the same amount of energy — demand for coal would actually increase, not decrease. In other words, he said, a drop in the cost of production often leads to greater production.

Televised citations (and recitations) of Jevons took off on Monday Jan. 27, as the U.S. stock market was rattled.

A Chinese artificial intelligence start-up, DeepSeek, became an overnight sensation when its app shot to the top of Apple’s App Store following the release of its latest reasoning model. The Chinese company had created an A.I. tool with analytical capabilities rivaling those developed by Google and Microsoft’s OpenAI. And, it appeared, the company had done it at a fraction of the cost.

That sparked an “oh, expletive” panic for U.S. investors who had been shoveling trillions of dollars into the megatech firms that were building and buying advanced U.S. chips for A.I.

Nvidia — the center of the American A.I. universe, and the world’s most valuable company — experienced a staggering one-day rout, losing hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization.
