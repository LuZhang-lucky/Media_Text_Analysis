Last month, U.S. financial markets tumbled after a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek said it had built one of the worldâ€™s most powerful artificial intelligence systems using far fewer computer chips than many experts thought possible.

A.I. companies typically train their chatbots using supercomputers packed with 16,000 specialized chips or more. But DeepSeek said it needed only about 2,000.

As DeepSeek engineers detailed in a research paper published just after Christmas, the start-up used several technological tricks to significantly reduce the cost of building its system. Its engineers needed only about $6 million in raw computing power, roughly one-tenth of what Meta spent in building its latest A.I. technology.

What exactly did DeepSeek do? Here is a guide.

How are A.I. technologies built?

The leading A.I. technologies are based on what scientists call neural networks, mathematical systems that learn their skills by analyzing enormous amounts of data.
