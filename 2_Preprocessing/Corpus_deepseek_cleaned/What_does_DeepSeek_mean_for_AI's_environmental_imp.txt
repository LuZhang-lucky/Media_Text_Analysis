new u firm stargate announce half trilliondollar investment artificial intelligence china deepseek shake industry mean ai environmental impact chinese artificial intelligence firm deepseek drop new ai chatbot say much cheap system operate u tech giant like microsoft google could make technology less power hungry could big environment climate implication train run current ai model require vast amount energy longheld assumption next ai wave would require massive data center expansion satisfy increase demand todays data center already consume global electricity accord international energy agency ai huge ferocious appetite essentially energy say paul deane senior lecturer clean energy future university college cork ireland much energy ai need there plenty hype ai could apply help find cure cancer combat climate change hype apply future ai energy demand projection say deane deepseek launch ai chatbot u president donald trump announce large ai infrastructure project far history newly found ai company stargate company say would immediately pump billion billion facility like data center lot large company build large data center run large ai algorithm say deane financial service company goldman sachs estimate data center power demand could grow global electricity use could rise around already ask openais chatgpt question use nearly times much electricity one google search data center need access power quickly say deane ai certainly partner well thing like solar battery say deane would potentially work many region around world take long build pair energyhungry data center solar park could work well particularly sunny place like texas u image scott colemanzumapicture alliance small modular nuclear reactor company like microsoft invest provide energy data center long way commercial viability add state moment theres big interest coupling ai cheap gas build relatively quickly say deane thats case one stargate data center texas accord u medium report burn fossil fuel like gas also drive greenhouse gas emission cause planetary heating data center emission may double accord goldman sachs ai need much water lot water use produce powerful microchip need run ais extremely fast calculation manufacture one chip take gallon liter water ai chip also emit heat meaning data center require water keep server facility cool study make ai less thirsty university california riverside find training largelanguage model like openais chat gpt consume million liter water run query use milliliter depend world take place ask ai model write work email generate picture unicorn mar like dump half liter water use fossil fuel nuclear hydroelectric plant power data center also huge amount water consumption say shaolei ren professor electrical computer engineering university california riverside ren coauthored uc riverside study find ai could withdraw billion cubic meter water year globally thats around six time denmark data center need lot water cool server build droughtridden region put even big strain supply image bruno kellyreuters country like ireland arent water stress doesnt pose major problem use crazy amount water arizona spain uruguay thats good practice say ren ai run less environmental impact cant put genie back bottle certainly try make genie good cleaner efficient say paul deane ucc one big way reduce data center environmental impact make energy theyre use clean efficient say deane would mean building renewables battery power data center locate data center there already abundant solar wind supply data center train ai model could also operate daylight hour take advantage sun energy side technology timesensitive come people use ai energy need around clock require large storage battery renewables less use climatefriendly energy source like gas use excess heat data center district heat nearby community could also help use energy efficiently location say deane reduce water footprint ai come water ren say ai company need transparent much use consider climate resource choose data center location droughtprone area region need really careful much water pressure put local water body say ren reuse recycle water rainwater harvest well implement closedloop liquid cool system also help cut water use say like energy ai train schedule public water use low data center well water efficiency waterconscious ai user could use technology water efficienthours efficient chip could also help reduce environmental impact ai image imaginechinatuchongimago image deepseek make ai less energyhungry deepseaks technology could mean prediction ai expand resource use exaggerate plan data center might need company use much small amount resource performance par openais new model thats really impressive say ren deepseek claim tech efficient didnt access u company nvidias powerful ai chip innovate instead deepseek turn live hype new data center build future might operate efficiently query might even run smartphones need data center still potentially efficient technology could lead something call jevons paradox warn expert mean efficiency gain eaten result increase demand cost use technology drop whether go see continued growth there lot uncertainty say ren edit anke rasper
