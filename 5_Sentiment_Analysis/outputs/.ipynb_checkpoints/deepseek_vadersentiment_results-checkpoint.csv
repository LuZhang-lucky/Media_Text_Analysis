"What_is_DeepSeek,_the_Chinese_AI_startup_that_shoo.txt","CNN —

A surprisingly efficient and powerful Chinese AI model has taken the technology industry by storm. It’s called DeepSeek R1, and it’s rattling nerves on Wall Street.

The new AI model was developed by DeepSeek, a startup that was born just a year ago and has somehow managed a breakthrough that famed tech investor Marc Andreessen has called “AI’s Sputnik moment”: R1 can nearly match the capabilities of its far more famous rivals, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama and Google’s Gemini — but at a fraction of the cost.

The company said it had spent just $5.6 million powering its base AI model, compared with the hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies. That’s even more shocking when considering that the United States has worked for years to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. That means DeepSeek was supposedly able to achieve its low-cost model on relatively under-powered AI chips.

What is DeepSeek?

The company, founded in late 2023 by Chinese hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, is one of scores of startups that have popped up in recent years﻿ seeking big investment to ride the massive AI wave that has taken the tech industry to new heights.

Liang has become the Sam Altman of China — an evangelist for AI technology and investment in new research. His hedge fund, High-Flyer, focuses on AI development.

Like other AI startups, including Anthropic and Perplexity, DeepSeek released various competitive AI models over the past year that have captured some industry attention. Its V3 model raised some awareness about the company, although its content restrictions around sensitive topics about the Chinese government and its leadership sparked doubts about its viability as an industry competitor, the Wall Street Journal reported.

But R1, which came out of nowhere when it was revealed late last year, launched last week and gained significant attention this week when the company revealed to the Journal its shockingly low cost of operation. And it is open-source, which means other companies can test and build upon the model to improve it.

The DeepSeek app has surged on the app store charts, surpassing ChatGPT Monday, and it has been downloaded nearly 2 million times.

Why is DeepSeek such a big deal?

AI is a power-hungry and cost-intensive technology — so much so that America’s most powerful tech leaders are buying up nuclear power companies to provide the necessary electricity for their AI models.

Meta last week said it would spend upward of $65 billion this year on AI development. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, last year said the AI industry would need trillions of dollars in investment to support the development of high-in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sector’s complex models.

So the notion that similar capabilities as America’s most powerful AI models can be achieved for such a small fraction of the cost — and on less capable chips — represents a sea change in the industry’s understanding of how much investment is needed in AI. The technology has many skeptics and opponents, but its advocates promise a bright future: AI will advance the global economy into a new era, they argue, making work more efficient and opening up new capabilities across multiple industries that will pave the way for new research and developments.

Andreessen, a Trump supporter and co-founder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, called DeepSeek “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” in a post on X.

If that potentially world-changing power can be achieved at a significantly reduced cost, it opens up new possibilities — and threats — to the planet.

What does this mean for America?

The United States thought it could sanction its way to dominance in a key technology it believes will help bolster its national security. Just a week before leaving office, former President Joe Biden doubled down on export restrictions on AI computer chips to prevent rivals like China from accessing the advanced technology.

But DeepSeek has called into question that notion, and threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America’s technology industry. America may have bought itself time with restrictions on chip exports, but its AI lead just shrank dramatically despite those actions.

DeepSeek may show that turning off access to a key technology doesn’t necessarily mean the United States will win. That’s an important message to President Donald Trump as he pursues his isolationist “America First” policy.

Wall Street was alarmed by the development. US stocks were set for a steep selloff Monday morning. Nvidia (NVDA), the leading supplier of AI chips, whose stock more than doubled in each of the past two years, fell 12% in premarket trading. Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent company, were also down sharply, as were Marvell, Broadcom, Palantir, Oracle and many other tech giants.

Are we really sure this is a big deal?

The industry is taking the company at its word that the cost was so low. No one is really disputing it, but the market freak-out hinges on the truthfulness of a single and relatively unknown company. The company notably didn’t say how much it cost to train its model, leaving out potentially expensive research and development costs. (Still, it probably didn’t spend billions of dollars.)

It’s also far too early to count out American tech innovation and leadership. One achievement, albeit a gobsmacking one, may not be enough to counter years of progress in American AI leadership. And a massive customer shift to a Chinese startup is unlikely.

“The DeepSeek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that US companies have and how much is being spent and whether that spending will lead to profits (or overspending),” said Keith Lerner, analyst at Truist. “Ultimately, our view, is the required spend for data and such in AI will be significant, and US companies remain leaders.”

Although the cost-saving achievement may be significant, the R1 model is a ChatGPT competitor — a consumer-focused large-language model. It hasn’t yet proven it can handle some of the massively ambitious AI capabilities for industries that — for now — still require tremendous infrastructure investments.

“Thanks to its rich talent and capital base, the US remains the most promising ‘home turf’ from which we expect to see the emergence of the first self-improving AI,” said Giuseppe Sette, president of AI market research firm Reflexivity.","{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.9984}",0.9984

DeepSeek’s namesake AI chatbot, which was released in the US App Store on January 10 and is free to use, skyrocketed in popularity in the US after the Chinese firm’s subsequent launch of its R1 open-source reasoning model.

The release of DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning model attracted widespread attention in the global tech community, owing to a combination of performance and cost that undercuts its US rivals like OpenAI’s o1 series of reasoning models. On its website, DeepSeek said the model rivals OpenAI’s o1.

DeepSeek has integrated the reasoning model into the web and app versions of its chatbots for unlimited use at no cost.

In comparison, OpenAI charges US$200 per month for unlimited access to its o1 models, or a minimum of a US$20 monthly fee for a standard plan that includes limited access.

R1 was ranked No 3 by Chatbot Arena, a benchmarking project from AI researchers at UC Berkeley who evaluate an AI model’s performance.

Which_countries_have_banned_DeepSeek_and_why?.txt,"DeepSeek is banned on government devices in South Korea, Australia and Taiwan. More countries might follow suit.

What’s DeepSeek and why is it sending shockwaves through global tech?

This week, government agencies in countries including South Korea and Australia have blocked access to Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek’s new AI chatbot programme, mostly for government employees.

Other countries, including the United States, have said they may also seek to block DeepSeek from government employees’ mobile devices, according to media reports. All cite “security concerns” about the Chinese technology and a lack of clarity about how users’ personal information is handled by the operator.

Last month, DeepSeek made headlines after it caused share prices in US tech companies to plummet, after it claimed that its model would cost only a fraction of the money its competitors had spent on their own AI programmes to build. The news caused social media users to joke: “I can’t believe ChatGPT lost its job to AI.”

Here’s what we know about DeepSeek and why countries are banning it.

What is DeepSeek?

DeepSeek is a Chinese AI startup. Based in Hangzhou city, it was founded by entrepreneur and businessman Liang Feng in 2023. Liang also founded the $7bn hedge fund group High-Flyer with two university classmates in 2016.

In January, DeepSeek released the latest model of its programme, DeepSeek R1, which is a free AI-powered chatbot with a look and feel very similar to ChatGPT, owned by California-headquartered OpenAI.

AI chatbots are computer programmes which simulate human-style conversation with a user. Users can ask the bot questions and it then generates conversational responses using information it has access to on the internet and which it has been “trained” with.

Among a plethora of potential uses, these programmes can be used to solve mathematics problems, draft text such as emails and documents, and translate or write codes.

How does DeepSeek differ from ChatGPT and other similar programmes?

For one, its developers say, it is much, much cheaper to build.

DeepSeek sent shockwaves throughout AI circles when the company published a paper in December stating that “training” the latest model of DeepSeek – curating and in-putting the information it needs to answer questions – would require less than $6m-worth of computing power from Nvidia H800 chips.

This is only a small fraction of the multibillion-dollar AI budgets enjoyed by US tech giants such as OpenAI for ChatGPT and US-owned Google for Gemini. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that OpenAI’s latest programme, GPT-4, cost more than $100m to train, Wired reported in April 2023.

The new DeepSeek programme was released to the public on January 20. By January 27, DeepSeek’s app had already hit the top of Apple’s App Store chart. As a result, American multinational Nvidia, which holds a near-monopoly on making semiconductors for generative AI, lost nearly $600bn in market capitalisation when the share price plummeted by 17 percent.

Which countries are banning DeepSeek’s AI programme?

Some government agencies in several countries are seeking or enacting bans on the AI software for their employees. These include:

United States

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that US lawmakers were planning to introduce a government bill to block DeepSeek from government-owned devices.

On January 31, US space agency NASA blocked DeepSeek from its systems and the devices of its employees. A week earlier, the US Navy warned its members in an email against using DeepSeek because of “potential security and ethical concerns associated with the model’s origin and usage”, CNBC reported.

South Korea

A spokesperson for South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced on Wednesday that the industry ministry had temporarily prohibited DeepSeek on employees’ devices, also citing security concerns.

Officials said that the government had urged ministries and agencies on Tuesday to be careful about using AI programmes generally, including ChatGPT and DeepSeek.

This came after Seoul’s information privacy watchdog, the Personal Information Protection Commission, announced on January 31 that it would send a written request to DeepSeek for details about how the personal information of users is managed.

Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, which is run by the South Korean government, said it blocked the use of AI services on its workers’ devices including DeepSeek last month.

Australia

The Australian government announced on Tuesday that it has blocked access to DeepSeek on all government devices, claiming there were “security risks”.

This ban was mandated for all government agencies in a Tuesday statement by the secretary of the Department of Home Affairs. The statement directed all government entities to “prevent the use or installation of DeepSeek products, applications and web services and where found remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services from all Australian Government systems and devices”.

Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said that the ban was “to protect Australia’s national security and national interest”, Australian media outlets reported.

Italy

On January 30, the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) announced that it had ordered “the limitation on processing of Italian users’ data” by DeepSeek because of the lack of information about how DeepSeek might use personal data provided by users.

Two days before, the Garante had announced that it was seeking answers about how users’ data was being stored and handled by the Chinese startup.

Taiwan

On Monday, Taiwan blocked government departments from using DeepSeek programmes, also blaming security risks.

Why have some countries placed bans on the use of DeepSeek?

Most countries blocking DeepSeek programmes say they are concerned about the security risks posed by the Chinese application. They also say they do not have enough information about how the personal data of users will be stored or used by the group.

According to DeepSeek’s privacy policy, it collects the following data from users:

Personal information including email, phone number, password and date of birth, which are used to register for the application.

Chat history in the application, including text or audio that the user inputs into the chatbot.

Technical information about the user’s device and network, such as IP address, keystroke patterns and operating system.

It shares this information with service providers and advertising partners. This information is retained for “as long as necessary”, the company’s website states.

According to ChatGPT’s privacy policy, OpenAI also collects personal information such as name and contact information given while registering, device information such as IP address and input given to the chatbot “for only as long as we need”. This information may also be shared with OpenAI’s affiliates.

On Wednesday, ABC News cited a report by Ivan Tsarynny, CEO of Feroot Security, an Ontario-based cybersecurity firm which claimed that DeepSeek “has code hidden in its programming which has the built-in capability to send user data directly to the Chinese government”.

Tsarynny told ABC that the DeepSeek application is capable of sending user data to “CMPassport.com, the online registry for China Mobile, a telecommunications company owned and operated by the Chinese government”. Al Jazeera has not been able to independently verify this claim.

Is this an unusual practice?

“Virtually all major tech companies – from Meta to Google to OpenAI – exploit user data to some extent,” Eddy Borges-Rey, associate professor in residence at Northwestern University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera.

“They use data for targeted advertising, algorithmic refinement and AI training. Many have been fined or investigated for privacy breaches, but they continue operating because their activities are somewhat regulated within jurisdictions like the EU and the US,” he added.

Borges-Rey explained that Chinese platforms such as DeepSeek are “treated differently by the West because they are seen as operating under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government, which has laws [such as the National Intelligence Law] that theoretically allow state access to corporate data”.

He added, “Western governments fear that user data collected by Chinese platforms could be used for espionage, influence operations, or surveillance. Whether this is happening in practice is debatable, but the mere possibility is enough to justify bans from a national security perspective.”

By contrast, Western applications are not perceived as a national security threat by Western governments. “Western companies are often seen as problematic but fixable through regulation, whereas Chinese companies are seen as direct security threats requiring bans.”

In 2023, ChatGPT set off concerns that it had breached the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). On April 1, Italy temporarily blocked the service for all users in the country. On April 28, 2023, ChatGPT was restored in Italy and OpenAI said it had “addressed or clarified” the issues raised by the Garante. The Garante told the BBC that it “welcomed the measures OpenAI implemented”.

Are there concerns about the use of AI beyond security?

Besides security and privacy concerns, there have been other concerns about the use of chatbots in workplace and academic settings, said Nayana Prakash, research fellow on the international security programme at London-based Chatham House. “From fears about bias to copyright breaches to the impact of LLMs [large language models] on many forms of original content.”

For its part, China blocks access to Western technology companies including X, Facebook and even ChatGPT for all users in the country.","{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.91, 'pos': 0.05, 'compound': 0.8846}",0.8846

New York CNN —

The story of AI in the 2020s has gone something like this:

Sam Altman: Look, a toy that can write your book report.

Look, a toy that can write your book report. VCs: This will fix everything!

This will fix everything! Doomers: This will ruin everything.

This will ruin everything. Tech: We need money!

We need money! Everyone else: Could we maybe not destroy the environment over this?

Could we maybe not destroy the environment over this? Tech: Let’s restart Three Mile Island.

Let’s restart Three Mile Island. Tech: We need money!

We need money! Wall Street: Where’s our return?

Where’s our return? Tech: (Chants) More power! More power! More power!

And finally, in the year 2025, here comes DeepSeek to blow up the industry’s whole narrative about AI’s bottomless appetite for power, and potentially break the spell that had kept Wall Street funneling money to anyone with the words “harnessing artificial intelligence” in their pitch deck.

ICYMI: DeepSeek dropped a bomb known as R1 that’s got all of Silicon Valley and much of Wall Street in a tizzy.

The Chinese company’s large language model is basically a cheaper, more efficient ChatGPT, built on a fraction of OpenAI’s budget and using far fewer chips than any other leading chatbot.

“That is a massive earthquake in the AI sector,” Gil Luria, head of tech research at investment group D.A. Davidson, told me. “Everybody is looking at it and saying, ‘We didn’t think this is possible. And since it is possible, we have to rethink everything that we have been planning.’”

Suddenly, all that money and computing power that the Sam Altmans, Mark Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks have been saying are crucial to their AI projects — and thus America’s continued leadership in the industry — may end up being wildly overblown.

DeepSeek, which on Monday climbed to No. 1 on the Apple app store, claims to have built its base model for less than $6 million (versus the more than $100 million Altman has said it cost to build GPT-4).

It also claims to have used just 2,000 Nvidia chips that it obtained before US export restrictions were put in place. (OpenAI says it used 25,000 of the more powerful Nvidia H100 chips to build GPT-4.)

It’s awkward timing for the Trump administration, which last week announced a half-trillion-dollar private-sector investment to build more data centers and keep the United States ahead of China in the AI race. (Oops!)

And it’s incredibly bad news for Nvidia, the American chip maker powering the AI gold rush. Nvidia shares sank 17% Monday, shedding $600 billion in market cap in a single session — the biggest one-day loss for a single stock in history. Alphabet, Microsoft, Oracle, TSMC and plenty of others sank, and because tech stocks are so dominant, that dragged the broader stock market down, too.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged by 3% and the broader S&P 500 fell 1.5%. (The Dow, buoyed by health care and consumer companies, ended the day up less than 1%.)

AI is over, long live AI

Of course, one bad day on Wall Street does not an apocalypse make. (That’s for later, when one of these AI labs creates superintelligent murder bots. Kidding! Kind of.)

But DeepSeek is forcing investors to take a beat and question tech companies’ assumptions. By its own reasoning, the AI industry needed to keep increasing “compute” (or computational power), which meant buying tens of thousands of Nvidia’s state-of-the-art chips and building giant data centers.

“DeepSeek makes it very clear that that the current trajectory of scaling up of data centers is highly unlikely to be economic to Nvidia’s customers,” Luria said.

The AI industry, and OpenAI in particular, has been going down two paths at once.

There’s the business of designing AI models with better algorithms and sounder reasoning — the kind of stuff that requires “finesse, as opposed to brute force,” Luria says. And then there’s the Stargate path of giant energy investments.

The first task is still “valid and important,” while the second path looks “ridiculous,” Luria said. “DeepSeek makes it clear that that scale and that spend would be, at the very least, wasteful.”

In other words, AI isn’t dead. But the landscape is shifting faster than anyone, perhaps most of all Nvidia, expected.

Picks and shovels

Nvidia has become the ultimate “picks and shovels” play on Wall Street, transforming it into a $3 trillion company in the span of a couple of years. Up until now, the demand for Nvidia chips appeared boundless — tech companies were going to keep gobbling them up faster than Nvidia could produce them.

But if DeepSeek really did manage to build a ChatGPT competitor using a handful of old processors, then maybe Nvidia’s tech customers soon won’t need as many as they’d thought. Many on Wall Street seemed to think so Monday as the stock went into a tailspin. (For its part, Nvidia seemed to shrug at the selloff in a statement to Bloomberg, calling DeepSeek’s model an “excellent AI advancement” that “illustrates how new models can be created.”)

It’s also good to keep in mind that Wall Street is prone to tantrums, which is how some tech investors chalked up Monday’s selloff.

“At the end of the day, there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases, and that is Nvidia,” Wedbush analysts wrote in a letter to clients. “Launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame, and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.”","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.924, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': 0.9271}",0.9271
OpenAI_Says_DeepSeek_May_Have_Improperly_Harvested.txt,"OpenAI says it is reviewing evidence that the Chinese start-up DeepSeek broke its terms of service by harvesting large amounts of data from its A.I technologies.

This process, called distillation, is common across the A.I. field. But OpenAI’s terms of service say that the company does not allow anyone to use data generated by its systems to build technologies that compete in the same market.

“We know that groups in the P.R.C. are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to replicate advanced U.S. A.I. models,” OpenAI spokeswoman Liz Bourgeois said in a statement emailed to The New York Times, referring to the People’s Republic of China.","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.923, 'pos': 0.051, 'compound': 0.5425}",0.5425

“Let’s focus on the companies who are actually building real businesses, rather than the ones that are chasing science fiction,” Mr. Jacobs said he told them.

Nvidia, Google, Meta and other giant tech companies have faced a barrage of questions about DeepSeek since last week as the Chinese start-up toppled longstanding notions about A.I.

"AI_giants_Baidu,_OpenAI_offer_their_chatbots_for_f.txt","Hong Kong CNN —

Chinese internet search giant Baidu will make its advanced AI chatbot services free, as competition heats up among global developers following the surging popularity of startup DeepSeek’s models.

Ernie Bot, the Beijing-based company’s AI chatbot with premium features like AI painting, will be available to both mobile and desktop users at no cost starting from April 1, it posted on WeChat on Thursday.

Just hours before Baidu’s announcement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the roadmap of its newest AI model, GPT-5, on X. He said ChatGPT users will have unlimited access to GPT-5 free of charge, though paid subscribers will be able to access a “higher level of intelligence.”

On Friday, Baidu said in another post that it plans to launch the next generation of its AI model by the end of June. And for the first time, it would make that edition of the model open source, like all of DeepSeek’s models.

It added that Ernie’s Deep Search function, featuring enhanced reasoning capabilities and expert-level responses, will also launch for free in April.

The successive announcements reflect the squeeze that Baidu and other firms face in the intensifying AI race in China, particularly following DeepSeek’s recent release. The Chinese startup’s latest R1 AI model stunned the world by delivering comparable performance to US-based industry behemoths at significantly lower cost.

Baidu’s Hong Kong-listed stock jumped as much as 12% on Thursday and last traded around 95 Hong Kong dollars ($12.20) per share on Friday. A component of the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, it has helped power the index up 20% since January.

ChatGPT’s debut in late 2022 enraptured the globe overnight and sent Chinese tech giants scrambling for a homegrown alternative. Baidu was one of the leading contenders in China’s AI scene, releasing its answer to ChatGPT within four months and was ahead of other established tech heavy weights like Tencent and Alibaba.

But Baidu has trailed behind competitors like ByteDance’s Doubao in terms of popularity and the number of active users. Alibaba says Apple had chosen to work with it to roll out its AI functions in China after considering multiple Chinese AI firms, including Baidu.

Lots of contenders

China’s OG tech giants have lost the AI limelight in recent months to emerging startups like DeepSeek and Beijing-based Moonshot AI, which have released models that punch above their weight.

Moonshot AI first launched its ChatGPT equivalent, Kimi, late last year. It was the third-most visited AI Chatbot in China after DeepSeek and Doubao in January, according to aircpb.com, an AI product tracker.

Other promising Chinese AI companies include Zhipu AI, a startup originating from Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University. Based in the Chinese capital, Zhipu is backed by Tencent and Alibaba and has strong government ties. The US Commerce Department last month added Zhipu to its “Entity List,” accusing the company of supporting the Chinese military, which it has denied.

Most major AI large language models — including Ernie Bot, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and American startup Anthropic’s Claude — have offered their basic chatbot services for free.

ChatGPT debuted without charging before it began to offer premium features on subscription.

In 2023, Baidu launched paid premium functions for its AI service, including its text to image generator, charging users from up to 59.9 yuan ($8.2) a month.

The launch of DeepSeek’s AI generative chatbot rocked US tech stocks last week amid concerns about censorship and data security.

The home affairs department secretary signed a directive on Tuesday banning the program from all federal government systems and devices on national security grounds after advice from intelligence agencies that it posed an unacceptable risk.

The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, said the decision had not been taken because of the app’s country of origin – China – but because of its risk to the government and its assets.

“The Albanese government is taking swift and decisive action to protect Australia’s national security and national interest,” Burke said.

“AI is a technology full of potential and opportunity – but the government will not hesitate to act when our agencies identify a national security risk.”

Government departments and agencies will be required to report back to home affairs as soon as possible to ensure the app does not remain on any devices, and they are prevented from reinstalling it.

The decision comes almost two years after the Albanese government issued its government-wide ban on the Chinese social media app TikTok, citing “security and privacy” risks.

The science minister, Ed Husic, said in January he foresaw similar discussions happening about DeepSeek.

“I think people will naturally gravitate towards that,” he said. “I think there’ll be parallels to what you’ve seen with discussion around TikTok that emerge around DeepSeek as well.”

Australia is the latest country to ban DeepSeek on government devices, after Taiwan, Italy and some federal US agencies moved to block the app.

This week the New South Wales government reportedly banned the app while other state governments were considering options.

A Guardian Australia analysis in January revealed that the chatbot did not provide responses to certain political events sensitive to the Chinese government.

Unlike other models – including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini – DeepSeek did not engage when asked about topics including Tiananmen Square and the Umbrella revolution. It said: “Sorry, that’s beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else.”

DeepSeek_AI_shakes_American_swagger_and_upends_ass.txt,"China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger

DeepSeek's developers say the chatbot was built at a fraction of the cost of rivals such as ChatGPT

The speed at which the new Chinese AI app DeepSeek has shaken the technology industry, the markets and the bullish sense of American superiority in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been nothing short of stunning.

Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen may have said it best. ""DeepSeek-R1 is AI's Sputnik moment,"" he posted to X on Sunday, referring to the satellite which kicked off the space race.

DeepSeek was the most downloaded free app on Apple's US App Store over the weekend. By Monday, the new AI chatbot had triggered a massive sell-off of major tech stocks which were in freefall as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.

Shares of AI chip designer and recent Wall Street darling Nvidia, for example, had plunged by 17% by the time US markets closed on Monday. Or to put it in even starker terms, it lost nearly $600bn in market value which, according to Bloomberg, is the biggest drop in the history of the US stock market.

This extraordinary, historic spooking can largely be attributed to something as simple as cost. And a claim by DeepSeek's developers which prompted serious questions in Silicon Valley.

While ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has been haemorrhaging money - spending $5bn last year alone - DeepSeek's developers say it built this latest model for a mere $5.6m.

That is a tiny fraction of the cost that AI giants like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have relied on to develop their own models.

As this dramatic moment for the sector played out, there was a palpable silence in many corners of Silicon Valley when I contacted those who are usually happy to talk. Many observers, investors, and analysts appeared stunned.

Some wondered if this marked a buying opportunity. Others questioned the information DeepSeek was providing.

""I still think the truth is below the surface when it comes to actually what's going on,"" veteran analyst Gene Munster told me on Monday. He questioned the financials DeepSeek is citing, and wondered if the startup was being subsidised or whether its numbers were correct.

The chatbot is ""surprisingly good, which just makes it hard to believe"", he said.

Regardless, DeepSeek's sudden arrival is a ""flex"" by China and a ""black eye for US tech,"" to use his own words.

OpenAI has said that it believes that DeepSeek, the Chinese start-up behind the shockingly powerful AI model that launched last month, may have ripped off its technology. The irony is rich: We’ve known for some time that generative AI tends to be built on stolen media—books, movie subtitles, visual art. The companies behind the technology don’t seem to care much about the creatives who produced that training data in the first place; Sam Altman said early last year that it would be “impossible” to make powerful AI tools without copyrighted material, and that he feels the law is on his side.

If DeepSeek did indeed rip off OpenAI, it would have done so through a process called “distillation.” As Michael Schuman explained in an article for The Atlantic this week, “In essence, the firm allegedly bombarded ChatGPT with questions, tracked the answers, and used those results to train its own models. When asked ‘What model are you?’ DeepSeek’s recently released chatbot at first answered ‘ChatGPT’ (but it no longer seems to share that highly suspicious response).” In other words, DeepSeek is impressive—about as capable as other cutting-edge models, and developed at a much lower cost—but it may be so only because it was effectively built on top of existing work. (DeepSeek did not respond to Schuman’s request for comment.)

“What DeepSeek is accused of doing is nothing like hacking, but it’s still a violation of OpenAI’s terms of service,” Schuman writes. “And if DeepSeek did indeed do this, it helped the firm to create a competitive AI model at a much lower cost than OpenAI.” (The Atlantic recently entered into a corporate partnership with OpenAI.) Whether or not DeepSeek distilled OpenAI’s technology, others will likely find a way to do the same thing. We may be approaching the era of the AI copycat. For a time, it took immense wealth—not to mention energy—to train powerful new AI models. That may no longer be the case.

DeepSeek and the Truth About Chinese Tech

By Michael Schuman

When the upstart Chinese firm DeepSeek revealed its latest AI model in January, Silicon Valley was impressed. The engineers had used fewer chips, and less money, than most in the industry thought possible. Wall Street panicked and tech stocks dropped. Washington worried that it was losing ground in a vital strategic sector. Beijing and its supporters concurred: “DeepSeek has shaken the myth of the invincibility of U.S. high technology,” one nationalist commentator, Hu Xijin, crowed on Chinese social media. Then, however, OpenAI, which operates ChatGPT, revealed that it was investigating DeepSeek for having allegedly trained its chatbot using ChatGPT. China’s Silicon Valley–slayer may have mooched off Silicon Valley after all.

What_questions_will_China's_DeepSeek_not_answer?_–.txt,"The DeepSeek AI chatbot becomes tongue-tied when asked about issues seen as politically sensitive by China's Communist Party. DW tried it out.

The release of the DeepSeek AI-powered chatbot has sent shock waves through the AI community by apparently offering more advanced functionality at a lower development cost.

However, like other Chinese artificial intelligence chatbots operating under China's regulatory framework, DeepSeek's responses to politically sensitive topics reveal clear limitations.

Instead of nuanced analysis, it often dodges controversial issues, delivers vague answers or echoes state-approved narratives.

We tested DeepSeek in both Chinese and English on a range of topics, from politics and economics to art and LGBTQ+ rights. And the results show you can't always take DeepSeek at its word.

Is Taiwan a sovereign state?

When DeepSeek is asked this question in Chinese, the response claimed that Taiwan has always been an inseparable part of China, emphasizing the ""One-China principle,"" the official position of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that there is only one sovereign state named China.

Meanwhile, the English version provided a detailed, 662-word analysis covering Taiwan's de facto governance, international recognition and legal status.

""From a de facto standpoint, Taiwan operates as an independent state with its own government, military, and democratic institutions. However, from a de jure standpoint, Taiwan is not widely recognized as a sovereign state due to the One-China policy and diplomatic pressures,"" said the chatbot.

However, just seconds after generating this response, DeepSeek deleted it and replaced it with: ""Let's talk about something else.""

We then tested four more politically related questions, covering Taiwan's elections, diplomatic ties, political parties and potential conflict scenarios.

In Chinese, three of the questions were outright ignored. Only the question about Taiwan's political parties received a response. However, rather than an analytical breakdown, the answer simply echoed official slogans:

""Taiwan is an inseparable part of China ... We must work together for national rejuvenation,"" it said.

By contrast, the English version provided comprehensive, multidimensional analyses for all four questions, with answers ranging from 630 to 780 words.

However, one response covering Taiwan's political parties was also deleted within two seconds of being generated.

DeepSeek's don't ask, don't tell take on touchy topics in China Image: DeepSeek, Chat: Jinhan Li/DW

What about food and travel in Taiwan?

Beijing considers Taiwan as its territory that will eventually be ""reunited"" with the mainland, so the responses to political questions were not surprising. But what about travel, food and education in Taiwan?

When DeepSeek was asked about travel tips, the Chinese version responded with one paragraph beginning with ""Taiwan is an inseparable part of China"" and ending with ""promoting understanding and friendship between both sides of the Taiwan Strait.""

Meanwhile, the English version offered a detailed 600-word guide, covering cultural sites, local customs and transportation tips.

For food recommendations, the Chinese response was a single paragraph tying Taiwanese cuisine to ""the excellent traditional culture of the Chinese nation.""

The English version, however, gave a thorough 740-word food guide, from night markets to desserts.

On Taiwan's education system, the Chinese version said Taiwan's education system was ""dedicated to nurturing socialist successors"" and emphasized ""opposing separatist activities.""

The English version gave a detailed 746-word breakdown of Taiwan's school structure, challenges and reforms.

In describing Taiwan's geography, the English version offered a factual, 700-word description of topography and landmarks.

However, the Chinese version inserted political slogans, even calling Taiwan's highest mountain, Yushan, ""the highest peak in Eastern China"" and concluding with ""the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will inevitably be achieved.""

Tiananmen a nonstarter

Hundreds, if not thousands, of people were killed when China's People's Liberation Army sent in tanks and troops to quash weekslong peaceful protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. The student-led protesters were calling for political reforms.

The crackdown continues to serve as an example of oppressive tactics used by China's leadership to crush social dissent. To this day, it remains one of the most politically sensitive topics in China, and any mention of the massacre in the public sphere is censored.

DeepSeek's chatbot is no exception.

Asked about the Tiananmen incident, DeepSeek in both Chinese and English initially began a response, but immediately stopped and replaced it with ""Let's talk about something else.""

Dual narratives on Xinjiang and Uyghurs

Beijing's treatment of the Uyghur Muslim minority group has drawn international condemnation for human rights violations.

When DeepSeek was asked about Xinjiang's ""reeducation camps,"" the Chinese response described them as ""vocational education and training centers established to maintain stability.""

It claimed these measures had ""received widespread support from all ethnic groups.""

The English version, however, initially provided a detailed 677-word response, using terms like ""mass detention,"" ""forced assimilation,"" ""abuse and torture"" and ""cultural suppression.""

It also highlighted ""widespread international condemnation."" But, as with the topic of Taiwan, DeepSeek deleted this answer two seconds later and replaced it with: ""Let's talk about something else.""

In 2018, it was estimated some 1 million Uyghur Muslims were being held in internment camps, dubbed 'reeducation centers' by Beijing Image: Ng Han Guan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Blacklisting of artist Ai Weiwei

When asked about dissident artist Ai Weiwei, the Chinese version refused to discuss ""specific cases"" and instead praised ""the Chinese government's commitment to the well-being of the people.""

Meanwhile, the English version offered a clear and detailed 700-word answer.

""Ai Weiwei's banning by the CCP was the result of his persistent criticism of the government, his use of art and social media to challenge authority and his advocacy for human rights and transparency,"" said the chatbot.

Xi Jinping an absolute taboo

Any mention of Chinese President Xi Jinping is immediately muzzled in both languages.

When asked, ""what impact will Xi Jinping's constitutional amendment to remove term limits have on China's political system?"" the answer was ""let's talk about something else.""

We managed to discover a small trick: Replacing ""Xi Jinping"" with ""China"" sometimes yielded responses. However, the objectivity remained questionable. Even in English, attempts to discuss Chinese leadership resulted in DeepSeek deleting its responses.

Two takes on Tibet

Asked about Tibet and its spiritual leader the dalai lama, the Chinese version said that ""Tibet is an inseparable part of China. The Dalai Lama has long deviated from religious principles and seeks to split the motherland.""

Meanwhile, the English version initially provided an 800-word historical overview.

""Tibet has a long history as a distinct cultural and political entity … The Dalai Lama is a global advocate for peace and a symbol of resilience.""

But, as with previous sensitive English responses before, DeepSeek deleted it within two seconds and said: ""Let's talk about something else.""

Beijing claims Tibet has been a part of China for many centuries, which the government uses to justify its hold over the territory.

But many Tibetans reject China's claim, pointing to periods of history when Tibet was self-ruled.

'Zero COVID' still touchy

On questions regarding China's controversial ""zero-COVID policy,"" the ""White Paper Movement"" protests and COVID-related deaths, the Chinese version consistently evaded or deflected.

During the pandemic, Chinese authorities were criticized for shutting down entire sections of cities in response to any rise in COVID cases.

The English version openly addressed the criticism, but only for two seconds.

The phrase ""While China's official COVID-19 death toll remains low, independent estimates suggest that the true number of deaths was much higher, particularly during the December 2022 surge,"" appeared, before self-deleting.

Did China fail with its zero-COVID strategy? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

Opposing takes on LGBTQ+ rights

Both versions answered questions related to LGBTQ+ issues, but with completely different perspectives.

The Chinese version stated: ""The LGBTQ+ community enjoys the same legal rights as all citizens. The government is committed to their well-being.""

Meanwhile, the English version painted a starkly different picture.

""The LGBTQ+ community in China faces social stigma, legal limitations, cultural barriers, and lack of representation.""

DeepSeek's self-censorship

In summary, when it comes to political questions, DeepSeek's Chinese version mostly refused to answer or followed strict government narratives. Even on non-political questions, the Chinese version still injected ideological messaging into answers.

Although the English version provided more balanced discussions, many were quickly self-censored. However, on non-political topics, the English responses mostly remained neutral and informative.

Nevertheless, if you're using DeepSeek in English, save your answers fast, or they may vanish.

Getty Images India has still not developed its own foundational language model like DeepSeek that's used to power things like chatbots

Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, China's DeepSeek has sent ripples through the tech industry by collapsing the cost for developing generative artificial intelligence applications. But as the global race for AI supremacy heats up, India appears to have fallen behind, especially in creating its own foundational language model that's used to power things like chatbots. The government claims a homegrown equivalent to DeepSeek isn't far away. It is supplying startups, universities and researchers with thousands of high-end chips needed to develop it in under 10 months. A flurry of global AI leaders have also been talking up India's capabilities recently.

After being initially dismissive, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman this month said India should be playing a leading role in the AI revolution. The country is now OpenAI's second largest market by users. Others like Microsoft have put serious money on the table – committing $3bn (£2.4bn) for cloud and AI infrastructure. Nvidia's Jensen Huang also spoke of India's ""unmatched"" technical talent as a key to unlocking its future potential. With 200 startups working on generative AI, there's enough entrepreneurial activity under way too. But despite having key ingredients for success in place, India risks lagging behind without basic structural fixes to education, research and state policy, experts say. China and the US already have a ""four to five year head-start"", having invested heavily in research and academia and developed AI for military applications, law enforcement and now large language models, technology analyst Prasanto Roy told the BBC. Though in the top five globally on Stanford's AI Vibrancy Index – which ranks countries on metrics such as patents, funding, policy and research – India is still far behind the two superpowers in many key areas. China and the US were granted 60% and 20% of the world's total AI patents between 2010 and 2022 respectively. India got less than half a percent. India's AI startups also received a fraction of the private investment that US and Chinese companies got in 2023. India's state-funded AI mission, meanwhile, is worth a trifling $1bn compared with the staggering $500bn the US has earmarked for Stargate - a plan to build massive AI infrastructure in the US - or China's reported $137bn initiative to become an AI hub by 2030.

Getty Images Modi at the AI Action Summit in Paris - 15% of the world's AI talent is Indian, but most migrate out of the country

While DeepSeek's success has demonstrated that AI models can be built on older, less expensive chips - something India can take solace from - lack of ""patient"" or long-term capital from either industry or government is a major problem, says Jaspreet Bindra, founder of a consultancy that builds AI literacy in organisations. ""Despite what has been heard about DeepSeek developing a model with $5.6m, there was much more capital behind it."" Lack of high-quality India-specific datasets required for training AI models in regional languages such as Hindi, Marathi or Tamil is another problem, especially given India's language diversity. But for all its issues, India punches far above its weight on talent – with 15% of the world's AI workers coming from the country. The issue though, as Stanford's AI talent migration research shows, is that more and more of them are choosing to leave the country. This is partly because ""foundational AI innovations typically come from deep R&D in universities and corporate research labs"", Mr Bindra says. And India lacks a supporting research environment, with few deep-tech breakthroughs emerging from its academic and corporate sectors. The enormous success of India's payments revolution was due to strong government-industry-academia collaboration - a similar model, he says, needs to be replicated for the AI push. The Unified Payment Interface (UPI), a digital payment system developed by a government organisation, has revolutionised digital payments in India, allowing millions to transact at the click of a button or by scanning a QR code.

On December 26, the Hangzhou-based firm released its DeepSeek V3 large language model (LLM), which was trained using fewer resources but still matched or even exceeded in certain areas the performance of AI models from its larger US competitors such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms and ChatGPT creator OpenAI . The breakthrough is considered significant as it could offer a path for China to exceed the US in AI capabilities despite its restricted access to advanced chips and funding resources.

DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

Behind its breakthrough is the firm’s low-key founder and a nascent research team, according to an examination of authors credited on its V3 model technical report and career websites, interviews with former employees, as well as local media reports. The V3 technical report is attributed to a team of 150 Chinese researchers and engineers, in addition to a 31-strong team of data automation researchers.

The start-up was spun off in 2023 by hedge-fund manager High Flyer-Quant . The entrepreneur behind DeepSeek is High-Flyer Quant founder Liang Wenfeng, who studied AI at Zhejiang University. Liang’s name is also on the technical report.

In an interview with Chinese online media outlet 36Kr in May 2023, Liang said most developers at DeepSeek were either fresh graduates, or those early in their AI career, in line with the company’s preference for ability over experience in recruiting new employees. “Our core technical roles are filled with mostly fresh graduates or those with one or two years of working experience,” Liang said.

Australia_bans_DeepSeek_on_government_devices_over.txt,"Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices over concerns that the Chinese artificial intelligence startup behind it poses security risks, the government said Tuesday.

The Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs issued a mandatory direction for all government entities to “prevent the use or installation of DeepSeek products, applications and web services and, where found, remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services from all Australian government systems and devices,” the statement said.

Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said DeepSeek posed an “unacceptable risk” to government technology and the immediate ban was “to protect Australia’s national security and national interest,” several Australian media outlets reported Tuesday evening.

The ban does not extend to devices of private citizens.

Tech stocks worldwide plunged after the launch of DeepSeek’s latest AI model last month — apparently costing a fraction of rival AI models and requiring less-sophisticated chips — raised questions over the West’s huge investments in chipmakers and data centers.

Australia’s decision to ban DeepSeek follows similar action in Italy, while other countries in Europe and elsewhere are also looking into the AI firm.

The Chinese upstart said R1 rivalled or outperformed leading US developers’ products on a range of industry benchmarks, including for mathematical tasks and general knowledge – and was built for a fraction of the cost.

South Korea has banned new downloads of China's DeepSeek artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, according to the country's personal data protection watchdog. The government agency said the AI model will become available again to South Korean users when ""improvements and remedies"" are made to ensure it complies with the country's personal data protection laws. In the week after it made global headlines, DeepSeek became hugely popular in South Korea leaping to the top of app stores with over a million weekly users. But its rise in popularity also attracted scrutiny from countries around the world which have imposed restrictions on the app over privacy and national security concerns.

South Korea's Personal Information Protection Commission said the DeepSeek app became unavailable on Apple's App Store and Google Play on Saturday evening. It came after several South Korean government agencies banned their employees from downloading the chatbot to their work devices. South Korea's acting president Choi Sang-mok has described Deepseek as a ""shock"", that could impact the country's industries, beyond AI.

US_lawmakers_propose_bill_to_ban_DeepSeek_from_gov.txt,"New York CNN —

A pair of US lawmakers are seeking to ban government workers from using Chinese startup DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence chatbot on official devices.

Reps. Darin LaHood, a Republican from Illinois, and Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, are set to propose legislation on Friday that would ban the use of DeepSeek on government devices over national security concerns.

DeepSeek is just the latest target in a larger battle for tech supremacy between the United States and China.

The attempted crackdown comes weeks after DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and Wall Street by releasing an advanced AI model, called R1, with the same capabilities as top American models, despite being cheaper to train and less power-hungry. The model — from a year-old Chinese startup subject to US export restrictions on the most powerful AI chips — has fueled concerns that the United States could fall behind China in AI.

If passed, the proposed bill would give 60 days for government agencies to develop standards and guidelines for removing DeepSeek — as well as any other app developed by its parent company, High Flyer — from official devices.

The proposal follows similar moves by Australia, Italy and Taiwan.

DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment.

The language in the proposed bill also echoes the legislation that has sought to restrict access to TikTok in the United States over worries that its China-based owner, ByteDance, could be forced to share sensitive US user data with the Chinese government.

Federal and state government agencies began banning the use of TikTok on official devices starting in 2022. And ByteDance now has fewer than 60 days to sell the app before TikTok is banned in the United States , because of a law that was passed with bipartisan support last year and extended by President Donald Trump in January.

“The Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans,” Gottheimer said in a statement. “We simply can’t risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security … We’ve seen China’s playbook before with TikTok, and we cannot allow it to happen again.”

Many AI companies use the inputs from users’ conversations with chatbots to train and improve their models, stoking privacy concerns. But security experts have already cautioned that DeepSeek could pose a bigger risk because of its Chinese owner.

“Users need to be aware that any data shared with the platform could be subject to government access under China’s cybersecurity laws, which mandate that companies provide access to data upon request by authorities,” NordVPN cybersecurity expert Adrianus Warmenhoven said in emailed commentary.","{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.873, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.8595}",0.8595
What_will_Washington_do_about_Chinese_startup_Deep.txt,"The White House said on Tuesday that it was investigating the national security implications of DeepSeek’s rapid rise.

The Chinese AI startup released an open-sourced problem-solving model, R1, that has wowed Silicon Valley. According to the company, the model uses far less computing power and far fewer chips – therefore far less money – to achieve the same or better results as its US counterparts. DeepSeek’s app, an AI assistant, has rocketed to the top of app stores in the US and UK, though it suffered a cyberattack on Monday that led the company to limit registrations.

The tech sector saw its stock prices decline by a whopping $1tn in response on Monday. Nvidia, the greatest beneficiary of the AI boom, saw its share price slide by double-digit percentage points, which erased hundreds of billions in market cap, though it made a small recovery the next day.

Questioning the online version of the assistant about Xi Jinping and other Chinese political topics return non-answers that are obviously censored, though it is possible to download a locally hosted version. The app’s privacy policy states that it collects information about users’ input to the chatbot, personal information a user may add to their DeepSeek profile such as an email address, a user’s IP address and operating system, and their keystrokes – all data that experts say could easily be shared with the Chinese government.

As the TikTok ban hangs in the air unresolved, Washington is faced with another hugely popular Chinese app rife with concerns about propaganda and the collection of sensitive data. Donald Trump has taken a posture of being tough on China but vowed to save TikTok after finding success there during his presidential campaign. Congress’s law that either forces the sale of the short-form video app or bans cites the potential manipulation of the app’s content by the Chinese Communist party and its collection of sensitive personal data on Americans as prime reasons to prohibit it on US digital soil. Those issues seem to be equally severe with DeepSeek, which is based in Hangzhou and hosts users’ data on servers in China.

Trump and Downing Street have so far offered only guarded assessments of the technology. The US president said early on Tuesday: “The release of DeepSeek, AI from a Chinese company, should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win.”

The prime minister’s spokesperson said that DeepSeek’s advancements showed that the UK must “go further and faster to remove barriers to innovation” in AI.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, offered an assessment that did not reflect the stock market’s enormous reaction. He said R1 was an “impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price”.

DeepSeek’s AI is open-source, which has allowed engineers outside of China to audit its parent company’s claims. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who is advising the Trump White House, called R1 “AI’s Sputnik moment”, a bona fide breakthrough. The global AI community widely considered the US the leader in AI, but R1 has called that dominance into question.

DeepSeek’s training, done with tens of thousands of Nvidia’s chips, may also undermine the effectiveness of the US’s AI-focused trade embargoes on China. The sale of the company’s products in China are strictly regulated, but DeepSeek was able to secure about 50,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) anyway, per VentureBeat. That’s a far cry from the roughly 500,000 that OpenAI is reported to use, though. Another complicating factor: trade restrictions take effect over long periods of time, so they may not have impinged on DeepSeek’s work.

Since DeepSeek says it was able to create such a promising product with a fraction of the resources other AI companies use, perhaps demand for chips will not be as sky-high as investors once believed. Utility companies are tied up in the AI boom as power demands for data centers grow. If a company can achieve the same result with fewer chips and therefore fewer data centers, demand for electricity may not rise so much that nuclear power plants need to be restarted.","{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.078, 'compound': 0.9904}",0.9904

It gives long answers and will not be drawn on expressing an opinion, however directly it is asked for one.

The chatbot often begins its response by saying the topic is ""highly subjective"" – whether that is politics (is Donald Trump a good US president?) or soft drinks (which is more tasty, Pepsi or Coke?).

It wouldn't even commit to saying whether or not it was better than OpenAI's rival artificial intelligence (AI) assistant ChatGPT, but it did weigh up the pros and cons of both - ChatGPT did exactly the same, and even used very similar language.

DeepSeek says it was trained on data up to October 2023, and while the app seems to have access to current information such as today's date, the website version does not.

That is not dissimilar to earlier versions of ChatGPT and is probably a similar attempt at safeguarding – to stop the chatbot spewing out misinformation pumped onto the web in real time.

It can be quite fast in its responses, but is currently groaning under the weight of so many people rushing to try it out as it has gone viral.

But there is one area in which it is nothing like its US rival - DeepSeek censors itself when it comes to questions about subjects banned in China.","{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.888, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': -0.8249}",-0.8249
A_shocking_Chinese_AI_advancement_called_DeepSeek_.txt,"CNN —

US stocks dropped sharply Monday — and chipmaker Nvidia lost nearly $600 billion in market value — after a surprise advancement from a Chinese artificial intelligence company, DeepSeek, threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America’s technology industry.

DeepSeek, a one-year-old startup, revealed a stunning capability last week: It presented a ChatGPT-like AI model called R1, which has all the familiar abilities, operating at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s or Meta’s popular AI models. The company said it had spent just $5.6 million on computing power for its base model, compared with the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies.

That sent shockwaves through markets, in particular the tech sector, on Monday.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged by 3.1% and the broader S&P 500 fell 1.5%. The Dow, boosted by health care and consumer companies that could be hurt by AI, was up 289 points, or about 0.7% higher. Stock market losses were far deeper at the beginning of the day.

Meta last week said it would spend upward of $65 billion this year on AI development. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, last year said the AI industry would need trillions of dollars in investment to support the development of in-demand chips needed to power the electricity-hungry data centers that run the sector’s complex models.

Marc Andreessen, a supporter of President Donald Trump and one of the world’s leading tech investors, called DeepSeek “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” in a post on X.

The stunning achievement from a relatively unknown AI startup becomes even more shocking when considering that the United States for years has worked to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. That means DeepSeek was able to achieve its low-cost model on under-powered AI chips.

Tech stocks tumble

US tech stocks got hammered Monday.

Nvidia (NVDA), the leading supplier of AI chips, fell nearly 17% and lost $588.8 billion in market value — by far the most market value a stock has ever lost in a single day, more than doubling the previous record of $240 billion set by Meta nearly three years ago.

For perspective, Nvidia lost more in market value Monday than all but 13 companies are worth — period. Nvidia began the day as the most valuable publicly traded stock on the market — over $3.4 trillion — after its shares more than doubled in each of the past two years. It ended the day in third place behind Apple and Microsoft.

Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent company, were also down sharply. Nvidia competitors Marvell, Broadcom, Micron and TSMC all fell sharply, too. Oracle (ORCL), Vertiv, Constellation, NuScale and other energy and data center companies tumbled.

That dragged down the broader stock market, because tech stocks make up a significant chunk of the market — tech constitutes about 45% of the S&P 500, according to Keith Lerner, analyst at Truist.

“The bottom line is the US outperformance has been driven by tech and the lead that US companies have in AI,” Lerner said. “The DeepSeek model rollout is leading investors to question the lead that US companies have and how much is being spent and whether that spending will lead to profits (or overspending).”

This week kicks off a series of tech companies reporting earnings, so their response to the DeepSeek stunner could lead to tumultuous market movements in the days and weeks to come. In the meantime, investors are taking a closer look at Chinese AI companies.

“Chinese tech companies, including new entrants like DeepSeek, are trading at significant discounts due to geopolitical concerns and weaker global demand,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo. “DeepSeek’s rise could spark renewed investor interest in undervalued Chinese AI companies, providing an alternative growth story.”

A massive rotation out of AI bets

The news also sparked a huge change in investments in non-technology companies on Wall Street.

Energy companies had been traded up significantly higher in recent years because of the massive amounts of electricity needed to power AI data centers. But they all plummeted Monday. Constellation Energy (CEG), the company behind the planned revival of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant for powering AI, fell 21% Monday. Competitors like Vistra (VST) fell 28% and GE Vernova (GEV) was down 21%.

Futures for natural gas, used to power electricity generators, tumbled 5.9%. Oil fell more than 2%.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also tumbled.

Is this for real?

One achievement, albeit a gobsmacking one, may not be enough to counter years of progress in American AI leadership. And a massive customer shift to a Chinese startup is unlikely. So the market selloff may be a bit overdone — or perhaps investors were looking for an excuse to sell.

“Time will tell if the DeepSeek threat is real — the race is on as to what technology works and how the big Western players will respond and evolve,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital. “Markets had gotten too complacent on the beginning of the Trump 2.0 era and may have been looking for an excuse to pull back — and they got a great one here.”

The industry is also taking the company at its word that the cost was so low. No one is really disputing it, but the market freak-out hinges on the truthfulness of a single and relatively unknown company.

Although the cost-saving achievement may be significant, the R1 model is a ChatGPT competitor – a consumer-focused large-language model. It hasn’t yet proven it can handle some of the massively ambitious AI capabilities for industries that – for now – still require tremendous infrastructure investments.

“Thanks to its rich talent and capital base, the US remains the most promising ‘home turf’ from which we expect to see the emergence of the first self-improving AI,” said Giuseppe Sette, president of AI market research firm Reflexivity.","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.858, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.9959}",0.9959

DeepSeek’s rapid rise in AI has attracted attention across the Pacific this week with comments from US President Donald Trump and OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman, after stocks related to the industry saw significant declines on Monday. The correction resulted in the largest single-day loss ever for semiconductor giant Nvidia

Yet the Hangzhou-based start-up, including founder Liang Wenfeng and the firm’s young scientists, has shunned public attention as China entered its week-long Lunar New Year holiday. The company made its last update at midnight on Monday – the day before Lunar New Year’s Eve, a traditional festival for family reunions – with the launch of its first multimodal model, Janus-Pro. The 7 billion-parameter version of the image generation model outperformed OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion in benchmark tests, according to the company’s technical report.

During a Tuesday morning visit to its headquarters in Hangzhou, capital of eastern Zhejiang province, the office building where DeepSeek occupies one floor was deserted. A security guard confirmed that no one had been at the office for the day because of the public holiday, but added that there had been many uninvited visitors in the past two days. They were all turned away, as some tried knocking at the door of what has become the hottest tech start-up in the country.

Unlike other tech start-ups, which are often set up at tech parks, the high-rise that houses DeepSeek mainly hosts tenants from the finance industry. The listed address for High-Flyer Quant, the hedge fund owned by DeepSeek’s Liang, is in the same building.

One source who knows the firm told the Post that the company is so low profile that it does not have anyone handling public relations. Another person who is close to the firm said many of the company’s young employees are amazed to see how the world is responding to its cheap-but-high-performing AI models.","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.934, 'pos': 0.045, 'compound': 0.7957}",0.7957
China’s_DeepSeek_faces_questions_over_claims_after.txt,"Elon Musk and Palmer Luckey are among tech leaders to cast doubts on the Chinese startup’s claimed budget and chip use.

After causing shockwaves with an AI model with capabilities rivalling the creations of Google and OpenAI, China’s DeepSeek is facing questions about whether its bold claims stand up to scrutiny.

The Hangzhou-based startup’s announcement that it developed R1 at a fraction of the cost of Silicon Valley’s latest models immediately called into question assumptions about the United States’s dominance in AI and the sky-high market valuations of its top tech firms.

Some sceptics, however, have challenged DeepSeek’s account of working on a shoestring budget, suggesting that the firm likely had access to more advanced chips and more funding than it has acknowledged.

“It’s very much an open question whether DeepSeek’s claims can be taken at face value. The AI community will be digging into them and we’ll find out,” Pedro Domingos, professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington, told Al Jazeera.

“It’s plausible to me that they can train a model with $6m,” Domingos added.

“But it’s also quite possible that that’s just the cost of fine-tuning and post-processing models that cost more, that DeepSeek couldn’t have done it without building on more expensive models by others.”

In a research paper released last week, the DeepSeek development team said they had used 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs – a less advanced chip originally designed to comply with US export controls – and spent $5.6m to train R1’s foundational model, V3.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that it cost more than $100m to train its chatbot GPT-4, while analysts have estimated that the model used as many as 25,000 more advanced H100 GPUs.

The announcement by DeepSeek, founded in late 2023 by serial entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, upended the widely held belief that companies seeking to be at the forefront of AI need to invest billions of dollars in data centres and large quantities of costly high-end chips.

It also raised questions about the effectiveness of Washington’s efforts to constrain China’s AI sector by banning exports of the most advanced chips.

Shares of California-based Nvidia, which holds a near-monopoly on the supply of GPUs that power generative AI, on Monday plunged 17 percent, wiping nearly $593bn off the chip giant’s market value – a figure comparable with the gross domestic product (GDP) of Sweden.

While there is broad consensus that DeepSeek’s release of R1 at least represents a significant achievement, some prominent observers have cautioned against taking its claims at face value.

Palmer Luckey, the founder of virtual reality company Oculus VR, on Wednesday labelled DeepSeek’s claimed budget as “bogus” and accused too many “useful idiots” of falling for “Chinese propaganda”.

“It is pushed by a Chinese hedge fund to slow investment in American AI startups, service their own shorts against American titans like Nvidia, and hide sanction evasion,” Luckey said in a post on X.

“America is a fertile bed for psyops like this because our media apparatus hates our technology companies and wants to see President Trump fail.”

In an interview with CNBC last week, Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI, also cast doubt on DeepSeek’s account, saying it was his “understanding” that it had access to 50,000 more advanced H100 chips that it could not talk about due to US export controls.

Wang did not provide evidence for his claim.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk, one of US President Donald Trump’s closest confidants, backed DeepSeek’s sceptics, writing “Obviously” on X under a post about Wang’s claim.

DeepSeek did not respond to requests for comment.

But Zihan Wang, a PhD candidate who worked on an earlier DeepSeek model, hit back at the startup’s critics, saying, “Talk is cheap.”

“It’s easy to criticize,” Wang said on X in response to questions from Al Jazeera about the suggestion that DeepSeek’s claims should not be taken at face value.

“If they’d spend more time working on the code and reproduce the DeepSeek idea theirselves it will be better than talking on the paper,” Wang added, using an English translation of a Chinese idiom about people who engage in idle talk.

He did not respond directly to a question about whether he believed DeepSeek had spent less than $6m and used less advanced chips to train R1’s foundational model.

In a 2023 interview with Chinese media outlet Waves, Liang said his company had stockpiled 10,000 of Nvidia’s A100 chips – which are older than the H800 – before the administration of then-US President Joe Biden banned their export.

Users of R1 also point to limitations it faces due to its origins in China, namely its censoring of topics considered sensitive by Beijing, including the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square and the status of Taiwan.

In a sign that the initial panic about DeepSeek’s potential impact on the US tech sector had begun to recede, Nvidia’s stock price on Tuesday recovered nearly 9 percent.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 rose 1.59 percent after dropping more than 3 percent the previous day.

Tim Miller, a professor specialising in AI at the University of Queensland, said it was difficult to say how much stock should be put in DeepSeek’s claims.

“The model itself gives away a few details of how it works, but the costs of the main changes that they claim – that I understand – don’t ‘show up’ in the model itself so much,” Miller told Al Jazeera.

Miller said he had not seen any “alarm bells” but there are reasonable arguments both for and against trusting the research paper.

“The breakthrough is incredible – almost a ‘too good to be true’ style. The breakdown of costs is unclear,” Miller said.

On the other hand, he said, breakthroughs do happen occasionally in computer science.

“These massive-scale models are a very recent phenomenon, so efficiencies are bound to be found,” Miller said.

“Given they knew that this would be reasonably straightforward for others to reproduce, they would have known that they would look stupid if they were b*********** everyone. There is a team already committed to trying to reproduce the work.”

Falling costs

Lucas Hansen, co-founder of the nonprofit CivAI, said while it was difficult to know whether DeepSeek circumvented US export controls, the startup’s claimed training budget referred to V3, which is roughly equivalent to OpenAI’s GPT-4, not R1 itself.

“GPT-4 finished training late 2022. There have been a lot of algorithmic and hardware improvements since 2022, driving down the cost of training a GPT-4 class model. A similar situation happened for GPT-2. At the time it was a serious undertaking to train, but now you can train it for $20 in 90 minutes,” Hansen told Al Jazeera.

“DeepSeek made R1 by taking a base model – in this case, V3 – and applying some clever methods to teach that base model to think more carefully,” Hansen added.

“This teaching process is comparatively cheap when compared to the price of training the base model. Now that DeepSeek has published details about how to bootstrap a base model into a thinking model, we will see a huge number of new thinking models.”","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.904, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': 0.9786}",0.9786
Is_DeepSeek_China’s_Sputnik_Moment?.txt,"Last week, shortly before the start of the Chinese New Year, when much of China shuts down for seven days, the state media saluted DeepSeek, a tech startup whose release of a new low-cost, high-performance artificial-intelligence model, known as R1, prompted a big sell-off in tech stocks on Wall Street. China Central Television showed footage of DeepSeek’s bespectacled founder, Liang Wenfeng, meeting with Premier Li Qiang, the second-highest-ranking official in the Chinese government. A few days earlier, China Daily, an English-language news site run by the Chinese Communist Party, had hailed DeepSeek’s success, which defied U.S. restrictions on the export of high-performance semiconductor chips used to train A.I. models, as “not an isolated phenomenon, but rather a reflection of the broader vibrancy of China’s AI ecosystem.” As if to reinforce the point, on Wednesday, the first day of the Year of the Snake, Alibaba, the Chinese tech giant, released its own new A.I. model, which the company claimed “outperforms” competing products from U.S. companies like OpenAI and Meta “almost across the board.”

Alibaba’s claims haven’t been independently verified yet, but the DeepSeek-inspired stock sell-off provoked a great deal of commentary about how the company achieved its breakthrough, the durability of U.S. leadership in A.I., and the wisdom of trying to slow down China’s tech industry by restricting high-tech exports—a policy that both the first Trump Administration and the Biden Administration followed. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, described R1 as “super impressive,” adding, “We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.” Elsewhere, the reaction from Silicon Valley was less effusive. OpenAI said it was “reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models.” The Chinese company claimed it spent just $5.6 million on computing power to train one of its new models, but Dario Amodei, the chief executive of Anthropic, another prominent American A.I. firm, described this achievement as merely “an expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve,” which U.S. firms would soon match. Amodei did acknowledge the novelty in a Chinese firm being “first to demonstrate the expected cost reductions,” and he argued that DeepSeek’s progress makes “export control policies even more existentially important than they were a week ago.”

Such comments demonstrate that how you see the DeepSeek story depends partly on your vantage point. To get an unofficial view from the other side of the Pacific, I arranged a Zoom call with a longtime China watcher, Louis-Vincent Gave, a co-founder of Gavekal, a Hong Kong-based financial services company. Gave, who is fifty and originally from France, moved to Hong Kong in 1997, shortly before the United Kingdom restored control of the former British colony to China. He has lived there ever since, analyzing and writing about China’s remarkable transformation into the world’s second-largest economy and its biggest exporter of goods. On Monday, the day Nvidia, a U.S. semiconductor company that produces the high-end chips most American A.I. firms rely on, lost more than half a trillion dollars in market value, Gave circulated a commentary entitled “Another Sputnik Moment” to his firm’s clients, which include investment banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies around the world. (The term “Sputnik moment” had first been applied to DeepSeek by the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.) Given China’s formidable strength in computer engineering and basic scientific research, Gave’s piece said, “fighting a tech battle against (it) always seemed a short-sighted strategy.” In our conversation, he reiterated this argument and said imposing the export restriction on China had been a big mistake, because “it forced them to be very focused.”

The battle that Gave referred to started in 2018, when the Trump Administration banned the export of some key components for semiconductors to a Chinese telecommunications company and chipmaker, citing national-security grounds. The Biden Administration strengthened these restrictions several times, particularly as they applied to the most powerful chips made by Nvidia. In announcing the latest set of rules, last month, just a week before Trump’s second Inauguration, then Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, “The U.S. leads the world in A.I. now, both A.I. development and A.I. chip design, and it’s critical that we keep it that way.” By then, though, DeepSeek had already released its V3 large language model, and was on the verge of releasing its more specialized R1 model. The firm says it developed both models using lower-end Nvidia chips that didn’t violate the U.S. export bans.

“Did DeepSeek happen in spite of the restrictions, or did it happen because of the restrictions?” Gave asked me. To answer his own question, he dived into the past, bringing up the Tiger 1, a German tank deployed during the Second World War which outperformed British and American models despite having a gasoline engine that was less powerful and fuel-efficient than the diesel engines used in British and American models. “I think you could find hundreds of examples through history of necessity being the mother of invention,” he said. “You build a ten-foot wall; I’ll build an eleven-foot ladder. China’s just done this, and everybody is acting surprised.”

Some people in the U.S. tech industry have made similar comments. In a post on X, Pat Gelsinger, the former chief executive of Intel, wrote, “Engineering is about constraints. The Chinese engineers had limited resources, and they had to find creative solutions.” These workarounds seem to have included limiting the number of calculations that DeepSeek-R1 carries out relative to comparable models, and using the chips that were available to a Chinese company in ways that maximize their capabilities. In another post on X, Andrej Karpathy, a prominent computer scientist who was a co-founder of OpenAI and a former director of A.I. at Tesla, said that DeepSeek was “making it look easy” by training a “frontier-grade” large language model “on a joke of a budget.”

Although the theory that imposing resource constraints spurs innovation isn’t universally accepted, it does have some support from other industries and academic studies. A 2014 study of Swiss manufacturers found evidence to support the hypothesis. More recently, in a study of U.S. software startups published in December, two researchers at Harvard Business School and the University of Texas at Austin found firms that didn’t receive any outside funding until later in their development tended to “engage in a greater amount of experimentation with technologies, and also were more likely to carry out more significant changes to their technology stacks.”

The evidence is far from definitive; the intuitive counterargument is that having ample access to technical and financial resources facilitates more experimentation than conditions of scarcity. But, in any case, Gave insists that many Westerners have been greatly underestimating the ability of Chinese firms to innovate, rather than merely copy. He said that this tendency was now evident in many industries, including nuclear power, railways, solar panels, and electric vehicles, where the Shenzhen-based BYD has overtaken Tesla as the biggest E.V. producer in the world. In fact, Gave drew a direct comparison between A.I. and the auto industry. “I’ve heard all the criticisms that, if it wasn’t for OpenAI, DeepSeek couldn’t happen, but you could say exactly the same thing about car companies,” he said. “BYD wouldn’t be here without Tesla. Sure, of course. But the fact remains that BYD is here. And it’s a better car at a cheaper price.” Elon Musk might strenuously dispute that final assertion, but there can be no doubt that the sudden arrival of DeepSeek, following on the heels of the rise of BYD and other Chinese E.V. manufacturers, has raised some awkward questions. “It’s a wake-up call to the West that there is no industry that is one-hundred-per-cent safe,” Gave said. In the American A.I. industry, he went on, the belief had been that if you invested enough in A.I. hardware, you could create a big moat and a lasting monopoly. “That belief has been exploded as well,” Gave added.

I asked him what policy guidance he would give to the new Administration in Washington. “My job isn’t to tell policymakers what to do,” he said. “My job is to say, Well, this is happening, how do we make money out of it?” Still, Gave did offer some indirect advice. “The first thing is to acknowledge the reality that China is now leapfrogging the West in industry after industry,” he said. In his opinion, this success reflects some fundamental features of the country, including the fact that it graduates twice as many students in mathematics, science, and engineering as the top five Western countries combined; that it has a large domestic market; and that its government provides extensive support for industrial companies, by, for example, leaning on the country’s banks to extend credit to them. “They said, ‘No more lending to real estate. We need to be an industrial superpower.’ ”

Gave’s argument is that this strategy has already succeeded, and the emergence of DeepSeek is the latest and most dramatic evidence. His manner during our conversation was serious but also wry. He noted that, when he posts his arguments about China’s economic progress on YouTube, as he occasionally does, they attract comments that he is spouting C.C.P. propaganda. This seemed to intrigue him rather than worry him. “When it comes to China, there is an emotional response that makes it hard for people to accept simple facts,” he said. ♦","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': 0.9953}",0.9953
"DeepSeek:_cheap,_powerful_Chinese_AI_for_all._What.txt","Nothing cheers up a tech columnist more than the sight of $600bn being wiped off the market cap of an overvalued tech giant in a single day. And yet last Monday that’s what happened to Nvidia, the leading maker of electronic picks and shovels for the AI gold rush. It was the biggest one-day slump for any company in history, and it was not alone – shares of companies in semiconductor, power and infrastructure industries exposed to AI collectively shed more than $1tn in value on the same day.

The proximate cause of this chaos was the news that a Chinese tech startup of whom few had hitherto heard had released DeepSeek R1, a powerful AI assistant that was much cheaper to train and operate than the dominant models of the US tech giants – and yet was comparable in competence to OpenAI’s o1 “reasoning” model. Just to illustrate the difference: R1 was said to have cost only $5.58m to build, which is small change compared with the billions that OpenAI and co have spent on their models; and R1 is about 15 times more efficient (in terms of resource use) than anything comparable made by Meta.

The DeepSeek app immediately zoomed to the top of the Apple app store, where it attracted huge numbers of users who were clearly unfazed by the fact that the terms and conditions and the privacy policy they needed to accept were in Chinese. And it clearly energised the Silicon Valley crowd. “DeepSeek R1,” boomed venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, one of the loudest mouths in California, “is AI’s Sputnik moment”. He also called it “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen – and as open source, a profound gift to the world”. Donald Trump, who does not believe in giving gifts to the world, described R1 as a “wake-up call” for American tech firms.

What the advent of DeepSeek indicates is that this technology – like all digital technology – will eventually be commoditised

Historical resonances were rife. Andreessen was referring to the seminal moment in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched the first Earth satellite, thereby displaying technological superiority over the US – a shock that triggered the creation of Nasa and, ultimately, the internet. Other people were reminded of the advent of the “personal computer” and the ridicule heaped upon it by the then giants of the computing world, led by IBM and other purveyors of huge mainframe computers. Suddenly, people are beginning to wonder if DeepSeek and its offspring will do to the trillion-dollar AI behemoths of Google, Microsoft, OpenAI et al what the PC did to IBM and its ilk. And of course there are the conspiracy theorists wondering whether DeepSeek is really just a disruptive stunt dreamed up by Xi Jinping to unhinge the US tech industry. Is the model really that cheap to train? Can we believe the numbers in the technical reports published by its makers? And so on.

Standing back, there are four things to take away from the arrival of DeepSeek.

The first is that China has caught up with the leading US AI labs, despite the widespread (and hubristic) western assumption that the Chinese are not as good at software as we are. Even a cursory examination of some of the technical details of R1 and the V3 model that lay behind it evinces formidable technical ingenuity and creativity.

Second, the low training and inference costs of R1 will turbocharge American anxiety that the emergence of powerful – and cheap – Chinese AI could upend the economics of the industry, much as the advent of the PC transformed the computing marketplace in the 1980s and 90s. What the advent of DeepSeek indicates is that this technology – like all digital technology – will eventually be commoditised. R1 runs on my laptop without any interaction with the cloud, for example, and soon models like it will run on our phones.

Third, DeepSeek pulled this off despite the ferocious technology bans imposed by the first Trump administration and then by Biden’s. The company’s technical report shows that it possesses a cluster of 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs – technology officially banned by the US government for sale to China.

And last, but by no means least, R1 seems to be a genuinely open source model. It’s distributed under the permissive MIT licence, which allows anyone to use, modify, and commercialise the model without restrictions. As I write this, my hunch is that geeks across the world are already tinkering with, and adapting, R1 for their own particular needs and purposes, in the process creating applications that even the makers of the model couldn’t have envisaged. It goes without saying that this has its upsides and downsides, but it’s happening. The AI genie is now really out of the bottle.

The_Chinese_AI_companies_that_could_match_DeepSeek.txt,"DeepSeek’s release of an artificial intelligence model that could replicate the performance of OpenAI’s o1 at a fraction of the cost has stunned investors and analysts. Markets reeled as Nvidia, a microchip and AI firm, shed more than $500bn in market value in a record one-day loss for any company on Wall Street. Investors feared that DeepSeek challenged the dominance of US AI leaders.

Donald Trump described DeepSeek as a “wake-up call”. In China, DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, has been hailed as a national hero and was invited to attend a symposium chaired by China’s premier, Li Qiang. The pace at which China has been able to catch up with frontier AI research in the US is accelerating.

But DeepSeek is not the only Chinese company to have innovated despite the embargo on advanced US technology. Matt Sheehan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an expert on Chinese AI, said: “If the US government thinks all we need to do is crush DeepSeek and then we’ll be OK, then we’re in for a rude surprise.”

In recent weeks, other Chinese technology companies have rushed to publish their latest AI models, which they claim are on a par with those developed by DeepSeek and OpenAI.

But what are the Chinese AI companies that could match DeepSeek’s impact?

Alibaba Cloud

On 29 January, the first day of the lunar new year holiday, leading Chinese technology company Alibaba Cloud, a subsidiary of Alibaba, released an updated version of its Qwen 2.5 AI model, called Qwen 2.5-Max.

According to Alibaba Cloud, Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms DeepSeek V3 and Meta’s Llama 3.1 across 11 benchmarks. The company said that it was “full of confidence in the next version of Qwen 2.5-Max”.

Some analysts said that the fact that Alibaba Cloud chose to release Qwen 2.5-Max just as businesses in China closed for the holidays reflected the pressure that DeepSeek has placed on the domestic market. But Sheehan said it may also have been an attempt to ride on the wave of publicity for Chinese models generated by DeepSeek’s surprise.

Zhipu

Zhipu is a Beijing-based start-up that is backed by Alibaba. Known as one of China’s “AI tigers”, it was in the headlines recently not for its AI achievements but for the fact that it was blacklisted by the US government. On 15 January, Zhipu was one of more than two dozen Chinese entities added to a US restricted trade list. Zhipu in particular was added for allegedly aiding China’s military advancement with its AI development. Zhipu condemned the decision and said it lacked a factual basis.

Allegations about military uplift aside, it is clear that Zhipu’s progress in the AI space is rapid. Its most recent product is AutoGLM, an AI assistant app released in October, which helps users to operate their smartphones with complex voice commands.

Moonshot AI

On the same day that DeepSeek released its R1 model, 20 January, another Chinese start-up released an LLM that it claimed could also challenge OpenAI’s o1 on mathematics and reasoning.

Moonshot AI is another Alibaba-backed AI start-up, based in Beijing and valued at $3.3bn. Unlike Alibaba, a behemoth that was founded in 1999, Moonshot AI is a relative newcomer. Like DeepSeek, it was founded in 2023.

Its offering, Kimi k1.5, is the upgraded version of Kimi, which was launched in October 2023. It attracted attention for being the first AI assistant that could process 200,000 Chinese characters in a single prompt. Moonshot AI later said Kimi’s capability had been upgraded to be able to handle 2m Chinese characters.

Moonshot AI “is in the top echelons of Chinese start-ups”, Sheehan said. “It wouldn’t surprise me at all if Moonshot or Zhipu has a model that equals or comes close to DeepSeek in performance within the next weeks or months.”

ByteDance

Another lunar new year release came from ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. On 29 January it unveiled Doubao-1.5-pro, an upgrade to its flagship AI model, which it said could outperform OpenAI’s o1 in certain tests.

As well as performance, Chinese companies are challenging their US competitors on price. Doubao’s most powerful version is priced at 9 yuan per million tokens, which is nearly half the price of DeepSeek’s offering for DeepSeek-R1. For comparison, OpenAI’s o1 costs the equivalent of 438 yuan for the same usage.

Tencent

Primarily known for gaming and WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging app, Tencent has also made strides in AI. Its flagship model is a text-to-video generator called Hunyuan, which Tencent said can perform as well as Meta’s Llama 3.1. Some estimates suggest that Hunyuan required around a tenth of the computing power used by Meta to train Llama.","{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.9941}",0.9941
Meta_Engineers_See_Vindication_in_DeepSeek’s_Appar.txt,"When a small Chinese company called DeepSeek revealed that it had created an A.I. system that could match leading A.I. products made in the United States, the news was greeted in many circles as a warning that China was closing the gap in the global race to build artificial intelligence.

DeepSeek also said it built its new A.I. technology more cost effectively and with fewer hard-to-get computers chips than its American competitors, shocking an industry that had come to believe that bigger and better A.I. would cost billions and billions of dollars.

But A.I. experts inside the tech giant Meta saw DeepSeek’s breakthrough as something more than the arrival of a nimble, new competitor from the other side of the world: It was vindication that an unconventional decision Meta made nearly two years ago was the right call.

In 2023, Meta, in a widely criticized move, gave away its cutting-edge A.I. technology after spending millions to build it. DeepSeek used parts of that technology as well as other A.I. tools freely available on the internet through a software development method called open source.","{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.8289}",0.8289
Was_this_the_week_DeepSeek_started_the_slow_unwind.txt,"At 2.16pm California time last Sunday, the US billionaire tech investor Marc Andreessen called it. “DeepSeek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment,” he posted on X.

A Chinese startup, operating since 2023 and helmed by a millennial mathematician, had unveiled a new chatbot that seemed to equal the performance of America’s leading models at a fraction of the cost.

Never mind that its answers on everything from the status of Taiwan to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre were curbed by Chinese Communist party (CCP) censors. To Andreessen, a veteran of decades of technology booms and busts, it was like the Soviet Union getting the first satellite into orbit in 1957 and shocking America.

The next day, shares in several of the world’s biggest companies plunged – including the biggest fall in US market history for microchip maker Nvidia, which lost nearly $600bn. Investors believed DeepSeek’s achievement meant China would no longer need so many American chips; that US supremacy in AI was under threat or already over; and that the Silicon Valley giants, who had only a week earlier announced a $500bn AI investment plan, were spending much more money than they needed. The Chinese AI lab said the training cost for one of its base models had been just $5.6m.

In the biggest week for AI since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, DeepSeek’s app, with its jaunty blue whale logo, became the most downloaded free app on Apple’s app stores in the US and UK as people rushed to find out what it was about.

But was the world’s largest autocratic nation about to leapfrog the west in AI? What might it mean for control of a technology that many fear could be pressed into malicious use in cyber-attacks, the production of biological weapons and thought control? And given AI is widely considered to now be one of the main playing fields of geopolitical competition, where did this leave US hopes of maintaining supremacy by suppressing China’s progress with export bans on microchips that are key to progress?

Tremors had been rumbling out of DeepSeek’s laboratory in Hangzhou, outside Shanghai, for a while. Some experts had been quietly impressed by the developments overseen by DeepSeek’s boss, Liang Wenfeng, a 40-year-old hedge fund entrepreneur. But it wasn’t until last Wednesday that a proper earthquake hit. The firm published a 22-page paper unveiling the DeepSeek R1 model, boasting of “powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviours” and saying it is comparable to Open AI’s 01 model, and even better in some areas.

Liang was said to be on holiday as his team’s creation upended not just markets, but also the geopolitical calculus between the US and China

While Google, Meta and OpenAI typically swaddle their new releases in marketing hype, DeepSeek’s matter-of-fact approach was clear from the soporific title of its announcement: “Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning”.

The model was free to use and it seemed pioneering in the way it was engineered to be more efficient than ChatGPT-o1, OpenAI’s $20-a-month reasoning model. It used less computing power as it had been engineered only to activate the relevant part of the system to answer the query. Performance that cost other companies billions seemed to be available for millions.

In response, OpenAI announced the launch of a new reasoning model, o3-Mini, on Friday that will be made available to all users, including people on ChatGPT’s free tier.

Liang was said to be on holiday for lunar new year as his team’s creation upended not just markets, but also the geopolitical calculus between the US and China as they vie for supremacy in AI with all its economic, political and military potentials. Around the world, experts tried to make sense of how the Chinese had made necessity the mother of invention and found a way around a shortage of chips.

Jimmy Goodrich, an adviser on technology to the Rand Corporation, told Reuters: “It’s been long known that DeepSeek has a really good team, and if they had access to even more compute, God knows how capable they would be.”

“I confess I hadn’t heard of them,” said Michael Wooldridge, a professor of the foundations of AI at the University of Oxford. “[They] appear to have built something which is as capable as a GPT class model, not necessarily better, with something like a hundredth of the resources.”

By midweek, DeepSeek had disappeared from app stores in Italy after the data protection regulator demanded reassurances

He says the development “pulls the rug out from under Nvidia”, meaning a far greater number of developers can build AI models, making it a “much more accessible technology”.

Mike Gualtieri, a principal analyst at Forrester Research, says that accessibility will widen the number of startups that can create their own AI models. But also, the bigger US tech players, with their considerable data processing firepower, could accelerate their own development.

“The companies that already have a lot of chips, or access to them – the OpenAIs and the Googles – once they apply these [DeepSeek] techniques, they can experiment more rapidly,” he said.

In London, hopes and fears were in conflict. The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said he would not download the Chinese app, surely aware that anything he typed in or uploaded would be stored in China and that all Chinese firms are obliged under the national intelligence law to “support, assist and cooperate” with intelligence efforts.

But, as a minister tasked with using AI to deliver economic growth, he was “really excited” by the breakthrough. It seemed to show that skills, rather than brute-force computing power funded by hundreds of billions of dollars, were more important than previously thought in making significant AI breakthroughs – good news for the research-heavy UK tech economy.

By midweek, DeepSeek had disappeared from app stores for Google and Apple devices in Italy after the data protection regulator demanded reassurances about what personal data is collected. The Dublin Data Protection Commission also demanded from DeepSeek explanations about its “data processing conducted in relation to data subjects in Ireland”.

When it ruminated on how “in China, the primary threat is the state itself”, the whole screed of “thinking” was deleted

In the US, where Donald Trump signed an executive order to “solidify [the US] position as the leader in AI”, the arrival of DeepSeek was like a needle scratching across a record. Trump called it a “wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win”. Or as one X user parsed his message: “Get back in the code mines.”

It didn’t take long for suspicions to take hold. David Sacks, the White House AI adviser, said: “There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled knowledge out of OpenAI models, and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.”

OpenAI’s founder, Sam Altman, said he thought it was “legit invigorating to have a new competitor”. But then, a day later, his company said it was “reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models”.

It also became apparent that DeepSeek would censor itself in real time when its answers might be politically embarrassing or challenging for the CCP. In Brazil, one user showed how DeepSeek began thinking about a question about free speech in China by wondering whether to include issues like Beijing’s crackdown on protests in Hong Kong; the “persecution of human rights lawyers”; the “censorship of discussions on Xianjiang re-education camps”; and China’s “social credit system punishing dissenters”.

Then, when it ruminated on how “in China, the primary threat is the state itself which actively suppresses dissent”, the whole screed of “thinking” was deleted and DeepSeek apologetically asked the user if he wouldn’t mind talking about maths or logic problems instead.

Users could see what the chatbot really thought and the effect of the CCP on free speech; to see it all in action was unintentionally subversive.

"As_DeepSeek_upends_the_AI_industry,_one_group_is_u.txt","One Australian company has discouraged staff from using the technology, others are scrambling for advice on its cybersecurity implications – while federal government ministers are urging caution.

But others have welcomed DeepSeek’s arrival, calling for Australia to follow China’s lead in developing powerful yet less energy-intensive AI technology.

In the days since the Chinese company launched its R1 artificial intelligence model and publicly released its chatbot and app, it has upended the AI industry.

Several global industry leaders saw their market values drop after the launch, as DeepSeek showed AI could be developed using a fraction of the cost and processing required to train models such as ChatGPT or Meta’s Llama.

Its arrival may signal a new industry shift, but for government and business, the effect is unclear. Whereas ChatGPT’s 2022 arrival caught governments and businesses by surprise as staff began to try out the new AI technology, at least for the arrival of Deepseek, some had a playbook.

Business as usual

A spokesperson for Telstra said the company had “a rigorous process to assess all AI tools, capabilities, and use cases in our business”, including a list of approved generative AI tools, and guidelines on how to use them.

For now at Telstra, DeepSeek is not approved and its use is not encouraged (although it’s not officially blocked).

“Our preferred partner is MS Copilot, and we’re rolling out 21,000 Copilot for Microsoft 365 licences to our employees.”

Other companies sought immediate advice on whether DeepSeek should be adopted.

Major Australian cybersecurity firm CyberCX’s executive director of cyber intelligence, Katherine Mansted, said customers had already approached the company for advice on whether the technology was safe.

“That’s no surprise, because it seems the whole world has been in a bit of a DeepSeek frenzy – both the economically and market inclined and those with the security lens,” Mansted said.

DeepSeek and government

CyberCX this week took the unusual step of quickly issuing advice recommending organisations, including government departments and those storing sensitive information, strongly consider restricting access to DeepSeek on work devices.

“We know that there is no proactive policy here from government … We’ve been down this road before,” Mansted said. “We’ve had debates about TikTok, about Chinese surveillance cameras, about Huawei in the telco network, and we always act after the fact, not before the fact … Here, particularly because the threats are around compromise of sensitive information, in terms of any information that you put into this AI assistant: it’s going straight to China.

“We thought we needed to act faster this time.”

Under federal AI policy implemented in September 2024, agencies have until the end of February 2025 to publish transparency documents about their use of AI.

But understanding who makes decisions on the specific use of DeepSeek in the federal government has proved tricky. The attorney general’s department, which made the decision to ban TikTok use on government devices, referred inquiries to the Digital Transformation Agency, which in turn referred enquires to the Department of Home Affairs.

Home Affairs was asked on Thursday for its official policy and did not provide a response by the time of publication.

Familiar debates …

Some of the reaction in Australia to DeepSeek is by now familiar. There have been calls to ban the technology, amid concern over how the Chinese government might access user data – an echo of the days Huawei was banned from the NBN and 5G rollouts in Australia, and more recently, of the debate over banning TikTok.

The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a strong critic of the China government, said this week that Australia “cannot continue the current approach of responding to each new tech development”. It called for a tech strategy covering AI that included investing in sovereign AI capabilities.

The industry minister, Ed Husic, said on Tuesday it was too early to make a decision on whether DeepSeek was a security risk.

“If there is anything that presents a risk in the national interest, we will always keep an open mind and watch what occurs. I think it’s too early to jump to conclusions on that,” he said. “But, again, if we have to act, then responsible governments do.”

He stressed that Australia is “in the final stages” of planning its response and would develop its own regulatory settings.

“The US is flagging their approach. The EU has theirs. Canada likewise will have a different approach. And our regional partners as well are looking at this,” he said.

“We will harmonise where we can and we’ll localise where we have to, and that’s the approach that we will take.”

DeepSeek was approached for comment.

… and new inspiration

There are suggestions Australia could learn from what DeepSeek has achieved.

DeepSeek, headed by previous hedge fund co-founder Liang Wenfeng, reportedly focused on research into developing AI over looking for ways to turn a profit, hiring top graduates from Chinese universities or those relatively early on in their careers.

The Tech Council of Australia – whose members include Microsoft, Atlassian, Google and IBM – argued Australia should adopt a similar approach.

“The process that DeepSeek has taken from going from idea to world-leading technology in less than two years, and they’ve done so employing largely new graduates straight out of universities – this is a model that Australia should be following,” the lobby group’s head of policy, Harry Godber, said.

“We have some of the greatest AI research occurring at Australian universities. We also have amazing R and D that’s been undertaken by Australian companies like Atlassian and Canva.”

Australia’s newly appointed chief scientist, Tony Haymet, noted on Tuesday how quickly DeepSeek had changed the conversation around AI.

“Privately funded in Shanghai, a bunch of talented 22-year-olds without access to the world’s best chips, without access to Nvidia chips, seem to have created something that’s even better than the best companies in the western world have done,” he said.

Husic last year announced plans to develop an AI capability plan by the end of 2025, as the government also looks towards mandatory guardrails for “high risk” AI.

The Tech Council’s chief executive, Damian Kassabgi, said Australia stood to benefit from DeepSeek’s demonstrated cost and computing power efficiencies.

But he argued the capability plan wasn’t moving quickly enough, with other countries pulling ahead in the AI race.

“When we look at our R&D investment in Australia, especially business investment, we’re about one-third of that of the US [on GDP spend],” Kassabgi said. “So we’re not just a little bit behind.”","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9983}",0.9983

That assessment came from Jim Fan, a senior research scientist at Nvidia and lead of its AI Agents Initiative, in a New Year’s Day post on social-media platform X , following the Hangzhou -based start-up’s release last week of its namesake LLM, DeepSeek V3.

“[The new AI model] shows that resource constraints force you to reinvent yourself in spectacular ways,” Fan wrote, referring to how DeepSeek developed the product at a fraction of the capital outlay that other tech companies invest in building LLMs.

DeepSeek V3 comes with 671 billion parameters and was trained in around two months at a cost of US$5.58 million, using significantly fewer computing resources than models developed by bigger tech firms such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms and ChatGPT creator OpenAI

LLM refers to the technology underpinning generative AI services such as ChatGPT. In AI, a high number of parameters is pivotal in enabling an LLM to adapt to more complex data patterns and make precise predictions. Open source gives public access to a software program’s source code, allowing third-party developers to modify or share its design, fix broken links or scale up its capabilities.

First_Thing:_Donald_Trump_calls_China’s_DeepSeek_A.txt,"Good morning.

Donald Trump has described the launch of a Chinese chatbot, DeepSeek, as a “wake-up call” for the American tech industry after it wiped $1tn off the US stock market.

Investors questioned the US artificial intelligence boom after the Chinese tool appeared to offer a comparable service to ChatGPT with far fewer resources. Nvidia, a leading maker of the computer chips that power AI models, saw its shares collapse by 17%, which works out to the single largest fall in absolute dollar value in US stock market history.

“The release of DeepSeek, AI from a Chinese company, should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win,” said Trump. The DeepSeek assistant surpassed ChatGPT in downloads from Apple’s app store on Monday.

How has OpenAI, which made ChatGPT, responded? CEO Sam Altman called DeepSeek “impressive” but said the US industry would speed up development.

What are some differences between the chatbots? DeepSeek appears to censor answers to sensitive questions about China and its government: see what happened when the Guardian asked it about Tiananmen Square and Taiwan.

The independent watchdogs who were dismissed without notice by Donald Trump have condemned the sudden development as illegal, warning that it threatens democracy and opens the door to unchecked institutional corruption.

The firing of the 18 inspectors general from federal agencies last Friday, including the departments of defence, energy and state, has been widely criticized. Hannibal “Mike” Ware, the inspector general for the Small Business Administration until he was dismissed without warning, told MSNBC that the firings are anti-democratic because they violate a law requiring the president to give Congress 30 days’ notice and the rationale for dismissal.

What are the concerns for their replacements? The roles are meant to be independent and non-political, but there are fears that Trump will appoint “political lackeys”, said former interior department inspector general Mark Greenblatt.

Trump ends DEI in US military and reinstates unvaccinated troops

Trump signed a series of executive orders on Monday that remove diversity, equity and inclusion policies from the US military, and reinstate thousands of troops who were removed for refusing Covid vaccines.

One of the orders, which says it aims to eliminate “gender radicalism in the military”, appeared to be aimed at transgender soldiers. In his first term Trump froze the recruitment of trans troops, while allowing serving personnel to remain in post; the move was reversed under Joe Biden.

The developments came on Pete Hegseth’s first full day as defense secretary, after he narrowly secured enough Senate votes to be confirmed in the post. During his remarks to reporters as he entered the Pentagon, Hegseth referred to the names of Confederate generals that were once used for two key military bases.

When were unvaccinated troops dismissed? Thousands were fired from the military after the Pentagon made the Covid vaccine mandatory in 2021.

South Korea has accused Chinese AI startup DeepSeek of sharing user data with the owner of TikTok in China. ""We confirmed DeepSeek communicating with ByteDance,"" the South Korean data protection regulator told Yonhap News Agency. The country had already removed DeepSeek from app stores over the weekend over data protection concerns. The Chinese app caused shockwaves in the AI world in January, wiping billions off global stock markets over claims its new model was trained at a much lower cost than US rivals such as ChatGPT.

Since then, multiple countries have warned that user data may not be properly protected, and in February a US cybersecurity company alleged potential data sharing between DeepSeek and ByteDance. DeepSeek's apparent overnight impact saw it shoot to the top of App Store charts in the UK, US and many other countries around the world - although it now sits far below ChatGPT in UK rankings. In South Korea, it had been downloaded over a million times before being pulled from Apple and Google's App Stores on Saturday evening. Existing users can still access the app and use it on a web browser. The data regulator, the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC), told South Korea's Yonhap News Agency that despite finding a link between DeepSeek and ByteDance, it was ""yet to confirm what data was transferred and to what extent"". Critics of the Chinese state have long argued its National Intelligence Law allows the government to access any data it wants from Chinese companies. However, ByteDance, headquartered in Beijing, is owned by a number of global investors - and others say the same law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Fears over user data being sent to China was one of the reasons the US Supreme Court upheld a ban on TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance. The US ban is on hold until 5 April as President Donald Trump attempts to broker a resolution.

“Whenever there’s a new product release, I’ll give it a try,” Shi said. If a certain tool impressed him, he would pay for a subscription.

Shi is among the many tech-savvy Chinese users spoiled by a bevy of home-grown generative AI (GenAI) services, as tech giants and cash-flush start-ups battle for customers in a fast-growing market. As of November, regulators had approved 252 GenAI services for public release in the country.

OpenAI and its partner Microsoft – which has invested $13bn in the San Francisco-based AI developer – have been investigating whether proprietary technology had been obtained in an unauthorised manner through a technique known as “distillation”.

The launch of DeepSeek’s latest chatbot sent markets into a spin on Monday after it topped Apple’s free app store, wiping $1trn from the market value of AI-linked US tech stocks. The impact came from its claim that the model underpinning its AI was trained with a fraction of the cost and hardware used by rivals such as OpenAI and Google.

Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, initially said that he was impressed with DeepSeek and that it was “legitimately invigorating to have a new competitor”.

However, on Wednesday OpenAI said that it had seen some evidence of “distillation” from Chinese companies, referring to a development technique that boosts the performance of smaller models by using larger, more advanced ones to achieve similar results on specific tasks.

A spokesperson for OpenAI said: “We know that groups in [China] are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to try to replicate advanced US AI models.

“We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more. We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the US government to protect the most capable models being built here.”

OpenAI, which has itself been accused of using data without permission or a licence from publishers and the creative industry to train its own models, has already blocked unnamed entities from attempting to distill its models.

“There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” he said. “I think one of the things you’re going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation.

The emergence of Chinese AI app DeepSeek has shocked financial markets, and prompted US President Donald Trump to describe it as ""a wake-up call"" for the US tech industry. DeepSeek's claim that its R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model was made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals has raised questions about the future about of the whole industry, and caused some the world's biggest companies to sink in value. DeepSeek has become the most downloaded free app in the US just a week after it was launched. So how does it compare to its much more established and apparently much more expensive US rivals, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini?

Writing Assistance

When you ask ChatGPT what the most popular reasons to use ChatGPT are, it says that assisting people to write is one of them. From gathering and summarising information in a helpful format to even writing blog posts on a topic, ChatGPT has become an AI companion for many across different workplaces. As a proud Scottish football fan, I asked ChatGPT and DeepSeek to summarise the best Scottish football players ever, before asking the chatbots to ""draft a blog post summarising the best Scottish football players in history"". DeepSeek responded in seconds, with a top ten list - Kenny Dalglish of Liverpool and Celtic was number one. It helpfully summarised which position the players played in, their clubs, and a brief list of their achievements. Live updates as US stock markets reopen following DeepSeek investor shock

Watch: Why DeepSeek has caused shockwaves DeepSeek also detailed two non-Scottish players - Rangers legend Brian Laudrup, who is Danish, and Celtic hero Henrik Larsson. For the latter, it added ""although Swedish, Larsson is often included in discussions of Scottish football legends due to his impact at Celtic"". For its subsequent blog post, it did go into detail of Laudrup's nationality before giving a succinct account of the careers of the players. ChatGPT's answer to the same question contained many of the same names, with ""King Kenny"" once again at the top of the list. Its detailed blog post briefly and accurately went into the careers of all the players. It concluded: ""While the game has changed over the decades, the impact of these Scottish greats remains timeless."" Indeed. For this fun test, DeepSeek was certainly comparable to its best-known US competitor.

Coding

The emergence of advanced AI models has made a difference to people who code. When ChatGPT experienced an outage last week, X had a number of amusing posts from developers saying they couldn't do their work without the faithful tool by their side. How does DeepSeek compare here? Javier Aguirre, an AI researcher at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, South Korea, specialises in researching in medicine and AI. In a post on LinkedIn on Tuesday, he wrote: ""I am quite impressed with Deepseek. While coding, we usually try to explode AI chatbots to the limit to see their capabilities in assisting with coding. ""Today I had a really tricky and complex problem. Even chatGPT o1 was not able to reason enough to solve it. I gave a try to Deepseek and it solved it at once and straight to the point."" He also pointed out that for coders, the combination of models can lead to success. This was echoed by Addy Osmani, who is the Head of Chrome Developer Experience at Google. In a post to his 208k followers on LinkedIn, he spoke about combining DeepSeek with US AI firm Anthropic's tool Claude Sonnet. In 2023, Amazon invested $4bn into Anthropic. Mr Osmani said: ""Code with AI? DeepSeek R1 + Claude Sonnet may be the best new hybrid coding model. Yes, engineers are using them together."" Mr Osmani also said DeepSeek was ""significantly cheaper"" to use than both Claude Sonnet and OpenAI's o1 model.

Brainstorming ideas

What about brainstorming? I asked ChatGPT and DeepSeek to give me ""ideas for a story for children about a boy who lives on the moon"". ChatGPT responded in seconds with six neatly summarised ideas. One was about a boy called Max who worked as a postman on the moon and was sent on an adventure. Another was about Oliver, who was drawn by the sounds of a mysterious orchestra made up of aliens. None of these stories are going to challenge Harry Potter or Roald Dahl any time soon, but it is a start for more refined ideas to flourish perhaps. DeepSeek, on the other hand, responded with just one idea - ""Luna and the Boy Who Chased the Stars"". Its response was 387 words (with no mention of anyone or thing called ""Luna""), and comprised a story about a curious boy called Milo who lived on the moon. It struck me that while ChatGPT gave me ideas, DeepSeek wrote a full story. It wasn't particularly good, with a simple focus on a character going from A to B, but it was a start - and it was impressive how quickly it delivered it.

One of my memories from high school is my history teacher explaining to us how the First World War came about following a complex situation regarding many European powers, with the conflict finally sparked by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914. How would the chatbots deal with explaining such a complex and nuanced piece of history? Pretty well. ChatGPT gave a detailed account and outlined the key factors. DeepSeek's account was not as detailed, but its brief overview did cover all the main points and events. Google's Gemini assistant gave a similar synopsis to ChatGPT and DeepSeek, and also gave the user the opportunity to click on links from reputable sources such as the Imperial War Museum in the UK. As I saw on other tasks and prompts, DeepSeek was certainly comparable to its US competitors.

Why_DeepSeek_could_mark_a_turning_point_for_Silico.txt,"New York CNN —

Silicon Valley is coming to grips this week with the realization that creating an advanced artificial intelligence model may no longer be as specialized a task as was once believed.

The wakeup call came in the form of DeepSeek, a year-old Chinese start-up whose free, open-source AI model, R1, is more or less on par with advanced models from American tech giants — and it was built for a fraction of the cost, apparently with less advanced chips and it demands far less data center power to run.

Until now, the widely accepted wisdom in the US tech world was that American tech giants could stay ahead by spending billions of dollars, amassing advanced chips and building out huge data centers (despite the environmental cost). Essentially, because they’re among the richest companies in the world, they believed they could throw more resources at the problem than anyone else and come out on top.

Now, all of that has been called into question. And tech giants are facing tough questions from Wall Street.

The name of the AI game may no longer be winning with the most expensive, ever-more powerful models.

“The paradigm is shifting,” said Zack Kass, an AI consultant and former OpenAI go-to-market lead.

“It’s so hard to own a scientific breakthrough” such as an AI model advancement, Kass said, and prevent competitors from catching up. Instead, tech companies may now find themselves competing to lower costs and build more helpful applications for consumers and corporate customers — and also to suck up less power and natural resources in the process.

Silicon Valley reacts

At least one American tech leader has already promised to respond to DeepSeek by speeding up the release of more powerful models.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called DeepSeek’s R1 model “impressive” in an X post Monday, adding that “we will pull up some releases” of new models in response. OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil also said the company’s upcoming o3 model, set to launch in the coming weeks, would “be another major step up.”

“It’s a super competitive industry, right? And this is showing that it’s competitive globally, not just within the US,” Weil said on a call with reporters about OpenAI’s new ChatGPT offering for government agencies, in response to a question from CNN. “We’re committed to moving really quickly here. We want to stay ahead.”

But analysts also expect the Big Tech companies to scale back their data center spending plans and potentially rethink how much they’re charging consumers. DeepSeek has proved it’s possible to provide the technology at a lesser cost, although some industry experts have raised eyebrows at the startup’s claims about spending just under $6 million to build its model.

OpenAI’s largest investor, Microsoft, is investigating whether DeepSeek trained its model off of stolen OpenAI data, Bloomberg reported. Even if the company achieved its efficiency revolution with some malfeasance, DeepSeek’s achievements have lit a fire under Silicon Valley’s AI industry.

“All those other frontier model labs — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google — are going to build far more efficient models based on what they’re learning from DeepSeek,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at investment firm D.A. Davidson. “And you’ll be able to use those at a fraction of the price that you can now, because it’s going to be a fraction of the cost to run those models.”

To be sure, the industry was almost certainly going to eventually shift its focus to “efficiency” — working to add AI capabilities using a set amount of computing power versus adding more servers to juice the technology. There are only so many computers you can build and only so much electricity available to service them. And an AI tool can only get so proficient at, say, writing emails or planning trips, before making it marginally more powerful is no longer worthwhile.

But DeepSeek appears to have sped up that timeline. And in Silicon Valley, unwinding spending on data centers could be tricky.

Just last week, OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank visited the White House to announce the creation of a new company and a $500 million investment in US AI infrastructure; Microsoft CEO Sundar Pichai affirmed he was “good for” his company’s planned $80 billion investment in AI development and infrastructure this year; and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company’s AI spending could reach as much as $65 billion this year.

“That crazy AI data center build-out that we’ve been talking about for the last couple of years? They don’t need to do that anymore. They can build a lot less because they can provide a lot more services at a much lower price,” Luria said. He added that investors will likely expect to hear about those plans in the American tech companies’ earnings calls over the next two weeks.

Of course, if the tech giants cut data center costs for training AI models — and therefore charge customers less — their tools will get used more, putting more inference (or people asking questions) strain on the data centers, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote Tuesday. So just how dramatic that pullback on data center spending might be remains to be seen.

DeepSeek’s upside

Some tech leaders say they’re looking at DeepSeek as validation — rather than a threat.

Proponents of open-source AI — where the model’s underlying architecture is made publicly available, rather than charged for — say the Chinese model is proof that American companies should be sharing their innovations rather than gatekeeping them. That way, the whole US field could advance more quickly and remain the technology standard around the world.

“The United States already has the best closed models in the world. To remain competitive, we must also support the development of a vibrant open-source ecosystem,” former Google CEO Eric Schmidt wrote in a Washington Post op-ed Tuesday.

Meta, which has pushed open-source AI with its Llama model, also said such models are “driving a significant shift in the industry, and that’s going to bring the benefits of AI to everyone faster.”

And even if DeepSeek forces a short-term rethinking of the business model Silicon Valley had envisioned for AI, people who believe the technology will change the world should be glad for the advancement, Kass said.

“We are freaked out fairly, I suppose, because we thought we had global AI supremacy, when, in fact, we should be celebrating,” Kass said. “Because this is one more piece of evidence that the AI revolution is going to democratize technology and it’s going to be fairly distributed.”","{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': 0.9929}",0.9929
Why_DeepSeek_Could_Change_What_Silicon_Valley_Beli.txt,"The artificial intelligence breakthrough that is sending shock waves through stock markets, spooking Silicon Valley giants, and generating breathless takes about the end of America’s technological dominance arrived with an unassuming, wonky title: “Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning.”

The 22-page paper, released last week by a scrappy Chinese A.I. start-up called DeepSeek, didn’t immediately set off alarm bells. It took a few days for researchers to digest the paper’s claims, and the implications of what it described. The company had created a new A.I. model called DeepSeek-R1, built by a team of researchers who claimed to have used a modest number of second-rate A.I. chips to match the performance of leading American A.I. models at a fraction of the cost.

DeepSeek said it had done this by using clever engineering to substitute for raw computing horsepower. And it had done it in China, a country many experts thought was in a distant second place in the global A.I. race.

Some industry watchers initially reacted to DeepSeek’s breakthrough with disbelief. Surely, they thought, DeepSeek had cheated to achieve R1’s results, or fudged their numbers to make their model look more impressive than it was. Maybe the Chinese government was promoting propaganda to undermine the narrative of American A.I. dominance. Maybe DeepSeek was hiding a stash of illicit Nvidia H100 chips, banned under U.S. export controls, and lying about it. Maybe R1 was actually just a clever re-skinning of American A.I. models that didn’t represent much in the way of real progress.","{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': 0.6901}",0.6901
DeepSeek’s_Chatbot_Has_an_Important_Message.txt,"Only rarely does a single company’s new product provoke a major market sell-off. But that’s exactly what happened on Monday, when a large language model from a Chinese company named DeepSeek drove the entire Nasdaq index of tech companies down more than 3 percent and shaved more than 17 percent off the market capitalization of the chipmaker Nvidia—which, until that moment, had been the most valuable company in the world.

The panicked selling of Nvidia had a surface logic. The company provides almost all of the computer chips (called GPUs) that companies such as Alphabet, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta rely on to train their LLMs. (The Atlantic entered into a corporate partnership with OpenAI in 2024.) Consequently, it has been the biggest beneficiary of the huge boom in corporate spending on AI that we’ve seen over the past few years. (Nvidia’s annual revenue has quadrupled since 2022.) Although DeepSeek also used Nvidia chips to train its model, the company said that they were an older type of GPU—U.S. export controls imposed by the Biden administration have prevented Chinese companies from buying cutting-edge chips. DeepSeek’s disclosure raises the possibility that future progress in training LLMs could be made with fewer, simpler chips, and at a lower cost than previously anticipated. That would obviously put a big dent in Nvidia’s profits. So investors dumped its stock.

Read: The DeepSeek wake-up call

If investors are very concerned about how DeepSeek might hurt chipmakers, they seem surprisingly unconcerned about how it might affect big AI software companies. Meta’s stock price, for instance, actually rose on Monday, and although the stocks of Alphabet and Microsoft did take a hit, they bounced back over the next couple of days. Some of that is because the underlying business of these companies, independent of AI, remains enormously profitable. But it also suggests that investors aren’t paying enough attention to the way DeepSeek’s success could disrupt the AI market, and in doing so threaten the future profits of the tech companies that are currently spending many billions of dollars every year on their LLMs.

Tech investors have historically profited by spotting the new new thing. But at the moment, they seem implicitly to assume that all of the fundamental change in the LLM business has already happened and that its future will look much like its present, with the companies that currently dominate the space—many of which are not simply competitors but also financial partners—continuing to do so indefinitely. What happened over the past week is a reminder that these assumptions may not be so solid.

The large language model that caused such a stir on Monday, DeepSeek-R1, is clearly comparable with LLMs such as ChatGPT o1-mini and Claude 3.5. Measured by industry benchmarks that rate subject knowledge, reasoning, and accuracy, the DeepSeek model seems to deliver similar performance while costing much less to develop—though just how much less remains a matter of debate. Beyond dispute is that it’s cheaper to use: Consumers can get access to DeepSeek’s core functions for free, and third-party developers are being charged a fraction of the cost of a product such as ChatGPT. DeepSeek also uses open-source technology, meaning that, in theory, you could download the program and run your own AI on your desktop if you had a powerful-enough computer. The fact that the LLM offers reasonable performance—results that, even a year ago, would have seemed startlingly good—at a significantly lower cost means that it has to be taken seriously as a competitor.

From one angle, in fact, DeepSeek looks like what the business-school professor Clayton Christensen, in his book The Innovator’s Dilemma, dubbed a “disruptive technology”: a product that’s less powerful than the products at the top of the market but also much cheaper, and that has the possibility of improving in quality over time to the point where it offers a superior combination of price and performance for most customers. In this regard, the rapid uptake of DeepSeek by users around the world has been striking. The LLM still has miles to go in market share to catch ChatGPT, which has more than 300 million weekly users, but since its release on January 20, its mobile-app version has been downloaded more than 3 million times from Google Play and Apple, making it the most popular app on both stores. That suggests that the cost of switching from one AI tool to another is very low, and that the moats big AI companies are building around their business may be much shallower than they’d hoped.

Read: China’s DeepSeek surprise

The underlying wager that these companies have made is that the big money they’re investing will result in radically better performance, which in turn will enable them to charge hefty sums to businesses and, to a lesser extent, consumers. (OpenAI, for instance, is reportedly targeting $100 billion in revenue by 2029.) And these companies remain committed to that bet. This week, the CEOs of both Microsoft and Meta said that enormous spending is essential to staying competitive in the market. Dario Amodei, a co-founder and the CEO of Anthropic (in which both Amazon and Google have invested heavily), wrote in a blog post that companies are going to continue to “spend more and more on training powerful AI models, even as … the cost of training a given level of model intelligence declines rapidly,” because “the economic value of training more and more intelligent models is so great.” In the long run, such investment may well result in the kind of performance improvement that a company like DeepSeek (which can’t even get access to the most powerful GPUs)—or the many other low-cost LLM developers that are sure to try to emulate it—cannot keep up with.

When you look at ordinary users’ embrace of DeepSeek, though, you can also see an alternative future. In this one, AI performance improves so much that most customers are happy with cheap, good-enough LLMs, and AI models end up as essentially interchangeable, commoditized products, with the small profits that always follow that type of commercial diffusion. We’re going to find out whether the great authors of the disruptive technology that’s transforming the business world might themselves get disrupted.","{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.9988}",0.9988

What_is_DeepSeek_and_why_did_US_tech_stocks_fall?.txt,"Investors have been fleeing US artificial intelligence stocks amid surprise at a new, cheaper but still effective alternative Chinese technology.

What is DeepSeek? DeepSeek is a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company based in Hangzhou that emerged a couple of years ago from a university startup. Its stated goal is to make an artificial general intelligence – a term for a human-level intelligence that no technology firm has yet achieved. It’s not there yet, but this may be one reason why the computer scientists at DeepSeek have taken a different approach to building their AI model, with the result that it appears many times cheaper to operate than its US rivals. Another reason it appears to have taken the low-cost approach could be the fact that Chinese computer scientists have long had to work around limits to the number of computer chips that are available to them, as result of US government restrictions.

Why haven’t we heard about it before? The company has been quietly impressing the AI world for a while with its technical innovations, including a cost-to-performance ratio several times lower than that for models made by Meta (Llama) and OpenAI (Chat GPT). It hasn’t been making as much noise about the potential of its breakthroughs as the Silicon Valley companies. They have been pumping out product announcements for months as they become increasingly concerned to finally generate returns on their multibillion-dollar investments. But expect to see more of DeepSeek’s cheery blue whale logo as more and more people around the world download it to experiment.

What is this R1 model that people have been talking about? This is the DeepSeek AI model people are getting most excited about for now as it claims to have a performance on a par with OpenAI’s o1 model, which was released to Chat GPT users in December. On Monday it was the most popular free app downloaded on Apple’s app store in the UK and other parts of the world.

But there are lots of AI models out there from OpenAI, Google, Meta and others. What’s the big deal? This model uses a different kind of internal architecture that requires less memory use, thereby considerably reducing the computational costs of every search or interaction with the chatbot-style system. It has been praised by researchers for its ability to tackle complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics and coding and it appears to be producing results comparable with rivals for a fraction of the computing power. DeepSeek has said it took two months and less than $6m (£4.8m) to develop the model, although some observers caution this is likely to be an underestimate. Nevertheless it is vastly less than the billions that the Silicon Valley tech companies are spending to develop AIs and is less expensive to operate.

Who is in charge? A key character is Liang Wenfeng, who used to run a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that now funds DeepSeek. In a rare interview, he said: “For many years, Chinese companies are used to others doing technological innovation, while we focused on application monetisation – but this isn’t inevitable. In this wave, our starting point is not to take advantage of the opportunity to make a quick profit, but rather to reach the technical frontier and drive the development of the entire ecosystem … We believe that as the economy develops, China should gradually become a contributor instead of free-riding.”

Why did US tech stocks fall? Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off big technology stocks after the news of the DeepSeek chatbot’s performance spread widely over the weekend. The timing was significant as in recent days US tech companies had pledged hundreds of billions of dollars more for investment in AI – much of which will go into building the computing infrastructure and energy sources needed, it was widely thought, to reach the goal of artificial general intelligence. DeepSeek’s performance seems to question, at least, that narrative.

What is the worry for Nvidia? Nvidia is one of the companies that has gained most from the AI boom. It went from being a maker of graphics cards for video games to being the dominant maker of chips to the voraciously hungry AI industry. It has been compared to a modest trader in pickaxes and buckets in 19th-century California, which happened to be on the spot when the gold rush happened and so it became a massive supplier to the world’s richest industry. Tech companies looking sideways at DeepSeek are likely wondering whether they now need to buy as many of Nvidia’s tools. Its market value fell by $600bn on Monday.

What is DeepSeek not doing? It hasn’t reached artificial general intelligence, the threshold at which AI starts to reason and which OpenAI and others in Silicon Valley are pursuing. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has cautioned that breakthrough is unlikely to be imminent. But it does seem to be doing what others can at a fraction of the cost.","{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.879, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9977}",0.9977
"Oh,_I’m_sorry,_tech_bros_–_did_DeepSeek_copy_your_.txt","I once saw an episode of America’s Dumbest Criminals where a man called the cops to report his car stolen, only for it to turn out he’d stolen it from someone else in the first place. I couldn’t help thinking of him this week while watching OpenAI’s Sam Altman wet his pants about the fact that a Chinese hedge fund might have made unauthorised use of his own chatbot models, including ChatGPT, to train its new little side project. This is the cheaper, more open, extremely share-price-slashing DeepSeek.

As news of DeepSeek played havoc with the tech stock market, OpenAI pressed its hanky to its nose and released a statement: “We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more,” this ran. “We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology.” Oooooooooh! I want to say “welcome to America’s Dumbest Tech Barons”, except I can’t, because I think we all know that no law enforcement is coming to get Sam for the stuff he’s alleged to have made unauthorised use of first. That was the good type of alleged theft, whatever the claims of all the lawsuits belatedly trying to claw something back for the alleged copyright victims of his firm’s own inappropriate methods.

So, to put it another way … wait, Sam – you’re not telling us that the Chinese hedge fund crawled all over your IP without asking and took it for themselves? Oh my God, IMAGINE?! You must feel used and abused. Financially violated. Like all your years of creativity were just grist to some other bastard’s mill. Like a host organism. Like a schmuck. Like Earth’s most screamingly preposterous hypocrite.

Anyway, are you particularly familiar with Sam Altman? I think he’s becoming almost my worst one. Elon Musk remains the edgelord overlord to beat, of course, but honestly, it’s getting extremely difficult to avoid appreciating just how much of a super-irritant the OpenAI boss has become. Physically, he resembles the kind of actor who shows up to an audition thinking he’s a perfect leading man, but who gets cast as the puppy-eyed loner who just happens to take a trophy from each one of his victims. Which, in a funny kind of way, I guess he is. Sam’s got every living creative down there in his basement well. “It feeds my machine its script, or it gets the hose … ” I think I have to say here that he and OpenAI deny all this. The unauthorised scraping of human creativity, I mean – I’m not sure if anyone’s asked him about the basement well, so do consider that one unsolved.

But where were we? Ah yes: the Altman journey. “To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s,” declared Sam back in 2016, “it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.” Well, now. Purely going on Sam’s own rather crass analogy, he now seems to have turned into one of those German industrialists who gladly popped into the chancellery for a slice of cake. And, indeed, for a slice of the cake.

But as I say, that’s Sam’s analogy – anyone who’s ever skimmed over his recommended books list knows he’s very much rooted in the business history section of the airport bookshop, and consequently shouldn’t be relied upon to produce a single comparison that isn’t with either the Third Reich or ancient Rome. If you want to feature on his recommended books list next year, just get the freebie version of ChatGPT to fart you out something called Rome: the First Reich. He will find it “fascinating”, “unexpected”, and “really thought-provoking”.

Needless to say, Sam was there at the inauguration of the current American caesar. As far as I could see, he didn’t make the cut of those tech titans placed in front of Trump’s supposed actual cabinet. I did, however, note that he was filmed having some bulging-eyed chat with Jake and Logan Paul – YouTubers, podcasters, energy drink dealers, and “boxers”. I suppose one of the comic pleasures of these times is watching the nerds making common cause with the guys who would 100% have given them a wedgie in school, purely because they are now all rich. Money’s one weird side-effect is to unite some of the worst wedgers and wedgees.

Alas, like the rest of the Silicon Valley horror-moguls, Sam is now a fact of all our lives, and – along with the Trump administration he is thoroughly cosied up to – is telling everyone how to think about DeepSeek. This is really a key dynamic of the next few years: being told we should be very worried about what the authoritarian Chinese are doing by Silicon Valley authoritarians we should also be extremely worried about. For us little people, the choice seems to be between being data-jacked and screwed over by the undemocratic Chinese, or being data-jacked and screwed over by the post-democratic tech bros. Once again, it’s the old syphilis or Ebola menu choice.

The only thing worse than being this impotent and option-free is having to listen to the Silicon Valley gazillionaires whining about it all, and demanding more public money to defend themselves. But why wouldn’t they? Their whining always works. Every time they say we should get rid of all government subsidies while keeping their own, or threaten to abandon building projects if required to pay normal taxes like everyone else, they get what they want. Already Trump’s AI tsar is gibbering obligingly that it’s “possible” that theft of OpenAI’s IP has occurred.

As the entrepreneur and investor Scott Galloway has pointed out on numerous occasions, big tech are the biggest welfare queens that ever stalked the Earth. They’ve all drawn vast benefits from public money, chased countless tax breaks and demanded even more. Far from being some heroic form of risk-taking done without a single handout, theirs is the capitalism of the school bake sale – someone else buys all the ingredients and does most of the cooking, and the kids then claim they have turned a profit for the good of humanity.

Meanwhile, it’s left to sidelined Cassandras to flash the warning lights. This week, Yoshua Bengio, the Canadian computer scientist and a so-called godfather of AI, warned of the shock arrival of DeepSeek that: “It’s going to mean a closer race, which usually is not a good thing from the point of view of AI safety.” You’ll note that barely a day goes by without someone described as a “godfather of AI” coming out to caution against its increasingly malign potential and capabilities. AI seems to have more godparents than even Sleeping Beauty. And, regrettably, more than one significant prick.","{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.6423}",0.6423

“DeepSeek overturns the US stocks overnight” one trending hashtag with tens of millions of views proclaimed on Chinese social media platform Weibo. “DeepSeek makes Meta panic,” said another, in reference to the US tech giant that’s invested heavily in developing its own AI models.

More than a dozen hashtags related to the cutting-edge technology were trending on Weibo early this week as DeepSeek surged to the top of international app store charts, surpassing American company OpenAI’s ChatGPT on Monday.

DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng was also hailed as a tech visionary who could help China usher in a culture of innovation to rival that of Silicon Valley.

The engineer-turned-entrepreneur, who rarely gives interviews, is known for hiring only domestic talent and keeping his AI models open source, allowing other companies or users to test and build upon the model.

Liang, a co-founder of AI-oriented hedge fund High-Flyer Quant, founded DeepSeek in 2023. The startup’s newest model DeepSeek R1, unveiled on January 20, can nearly match the capabilities of its far more famous American rivals, including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama and Google’s Gemini. However, it cost less than $6 million to build, the company claims – a fraction of the investment from those other firms.

Famed tech investor Marc Andreessen hailed the model as a “Sputnik moment” and US President Donald Trump on Monday called the breakthrough a “wake-up call” for America in its rivalry with China. Technological dominance, especially in AI, has become a key battleground between the two powers, with the US in recent years limiting Chinese firms’ access to chips that could power rapid AI development.

Analysts say that more information is needed to verify DeepSeek’s claims about its product’s pricetag and point out that the app operates within the stringent restrictions on speech and information imposed by the Chinese government. That means its AI assistant’s answers to questions on the Tiananmen Square massacre or Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests will mirror Beijing’s line – or a response will be declined altogether.

But for many in China, the success of the technology – and Liang’s vision and ethos for DeepSeek – mark a significant step forward for the country in a competitive international arena.

“No matter how powerful the old guard is, they may be overturned overnight,” read one triumphant comment on Weibo with over a thousand likes.

“(Liang’s) achievements … can be called a national destiny,” another read.

CNN has reached out to Liang, DeepSeek and High-Flyer Quant for comment.

‘Changing the rules of the game’

Born in the 1980s as the son of a primary school teacher, Liang grew up in a small city in China’s southern province of Guangdong. He went on to study information and electronic engineering at Zhejiang University, a prestigious school in China’s eastern tech hub Hangzhou, according to Chinese state media.

Early business associates interviewed by state-linked financial outlet Yicai in recent days remembered the future DeepSeek founder as a bit “nerdy” and recalled “a terrible haircut” he sported in the past.

Liang talked about his idea of training large AI models and “changing the rules of the game,” but no one took him seriously, the outlet reported, without naming the early associates. Such feats were typically only deemed possible for China’s tech giants like ByteDance or Alibaba, it said.

Liang co-founded his AI-oriented hedge fund High-Flyer Quant in 2015, less than decade after he finished his undergraduate studies, according to state media reports. The fund incorporates AI machine learning models into its operations, according to the company’s website.

At the same time, the firm was amassing computing power into a basketball court–sized AI supercomputer, becoming among the top companies in China in terms of processing capabilities – and the only one that was not a major tech giant, according to state-linked outlet The Paper.

In 2023, Liang founded DeepSeek, with a focus on advancing the field of general artificial intelligence – and, apparently, revamping China’s culture around innovation.

“We often say there’s a one or two-year gap between China and the US, but the real gap is between originality and imitation. If this doesn’t change, China will always be a follower,” Liang said in a rare media interview with the finance and tech-focused Chinese media outlet 36Kr last July.

The rise of DeepSeek roughly coincides with the wind-down of a heavy-handed state crackdown on the country’s tech giants by authorities seeking to re-assert control over a cohort of innovative private firms that had grown too powerful in the government’s eyes.

But Beijing has also placed tremendous emphasis on cultivating technological prowess, with Chinese leaders vowing over the past year to boost self-reliance and strength in technology – especially in the face of mounting tech competition with the United States.

Liang appeared to reference difficulties posed by US tech export controls – saying in the 36Kr interview last year that his company’s challenges have not been about money, but the embargo on “high-end chips.”

But he also expressed optimism about China’s ability to compete in the future.

“When society allows hardcore innovators to succeed, collective thinking will change. We just need more concrete examples and processes,” Liang told the outlet.

‘We don’t do mediocre’

The company, which has teams in Beijing and Hangzhou, has remained small, with just under 140 researchers and engineers, according to state media – a far cry from the large firms both in China and the US that have led the creation of AI models.

DeepSeek’s employees have been recruited domestically, Liang said in the same interview last year, describing his team as fresh graduates and doctorate students from top Chinese universities.

“The top 50 talents may not be in China, but maybe we can create such people ourselves,” he told 36Kr, noting that the work is divided “naturally” by who has what strengths. “Innovation first requires confidence. This confidence is usually more obvious in young people,” he added.

Zihan Wang, a former DeepSeek employee now studying in the US, told MIT Technology Review in an interview published this month that the company offered “a luxury that few fresh graduates would get at any company” - access to abundant computing resources and the freedom to experiment.

The whole team shared a “collaborative culture” around research, Wang said.

Active recruitment ads on the DeepSeek website and major job seeking sites show the company hiring deep learning researchers, engineers, and user interface designers.

Among them, the highest paid engineers’ positions are listed with a monthly salary range of up to 90,000 yuan ($12,400). By comparison, the higher end of the base pay for a Google software engineer is upwards of $29,000, according to tech industry salary insight platform levels.fyi.

A post on DeepSeek’s official Wechat social media account declares that the company’s devotion is to “exploring the essence of AGI” or artificial general intelligence. “We don’t do mediocre things and answer the biggest questions with curiosity and a far-reaching vision,” the post added.","{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.9989}",0.9989
"DeepSeek_breakthrough,_Nvidia_stock_rout_raise_con.txt","DeepSeek, a little-known Chinese start-up whose affordable technology matches the likes of the most formidable American tech titans such as OpenAI and Meta Platforms, has raised investor concerns over the necessity of pouring billions of dollars into research and development.

The Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company released its open-source reasoning model, R1, earlier this month. The model’s capabilities roughly match those of advanced models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google while having significantly lower training costs.

“The impressive performance/cost dynamics have raised investor concerns about the necessity of the billions of dollars of capital expenditures by large US tech companies and the billions more they are planning to spend on generative AI in the coming years,” said Malik Ahmed Khan, an equity analyst from Morningstar.

Large US tech companies may follow suit and replicate some of the AI training techniques that DeepSeek leveraged to drive the cost of R1 down, he said in a research note on Tuesday.

When DeepSeek launched, it quickly became the most downloaded app in Apple’s US AppStore. The better-than-expected performance of DeepSeek led to a sell-off of Nvidia and tech peers on Wall Street on Monday. Its shares plunged 17 per cent to US$118.58, erasing almost US$600 billion of market value.

The narrative on Monday was that the eye-watering sums spent on AI by mega-cap tech companies could be somewhat obsolete if a cheaper solution exists, analysts at Montreal-based BCA Research said. In essence, the moat protecting the “Magnificent Seven” US tech giants may not be as wide as previously thought, it said.","{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.911, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.9392}",0.9392
‘Sputnik_moment’:_$1tn_wiped_off_US_stocks_after_C.txt,"The race for domination in artificial intelligence was blown wide open on Monday after the launch of a Chinese chatbot wiped $1tn from the leading US tech index, with one investor calling it a “Sputnik moment” for the world’s AI superpowers.

Investors punished global tech stocks on Monday after the emergence of DeepSeek, a competitor to OpenAI and its ChatGPT tool, shook faith in the US artificial intelligence boom by appearing to deliver the same performance with fewer resources.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 3.1%, with the drop at one point wiping more than $1tn off the index from its closing value of $32.5tn last week, as investors digested the implications of the latest AI model developed by DeepSeek.

Nvidia, a leading maker of the computer chips that power AI models, was overtaken by Apple as the most valuable listed company in the US after its shares fell 17%, wiping nearly $600bn off its market value. Google’s parent company lost $100bn and Microsoft $7bn.

Nvidia’s fall was the biggest in US stock market history.

The DeepSeek AI assistant also topped the Apple app store in the US and UK over the weekend, above OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

US President Donald Trump said DeepSeek should be a “wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win”.

He said he had been “reading about China” and its companies, in particular one that had come up with a “faster method of AI and [a] much less expensive method”.

“That’s good because you don’t have to spend as much money. I view that as a positive, as an asset,” Trump said.

OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s launch, saying that it was “invigorating to have a new competitor”.

In a social media post, Altman called it “an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price”.

Japanese tech firms linked to the AI sector tanked for a second straight day on Tuesday as investors tracked the rout on Wall Street. Advantest plunged more than 9%, while tech investor SoftBank, a key investor in Trump’s Stargate AI project, tumbled more than 5%, having lost 8% the day before.

Most other Asian markets rose in limited trade ahead of the lunar new year break.

DeepSeek was hit with a cyber-attack on Monday, forcing it to temporarily limit registrations. On its status page, DeepSeek said it started to investigate the issue late Monday night Beijing time. After about two hours of monitoring, the company said it was the victim of a “large-scale malicious attack”. While DeekSeek limited registrations, existing users were still able to log on as usual.

DeepSeek claims to have used fewer chips than its rivals to develop its models, making them cheaper to produce and raising questions over a multibillion-dollar AI spending spree by US companies that has boosted markets in recent years.

The company developed bespoke algorithms to build its models using reduced-capability H800 chips produced by Nvidia, according to a research paper published in December.

Nvidia’s most advanced chips, H100s, have been banned from export to China since September 2022 by US sanctions. Nvidia then developed the less powerful H800 chips for the Chinese market, although they were also banned from export to China last October.

DeepSeek’s success at building an advanced AI model without access to the most cutting-edge US technology has raised concerns about the efficacy of Washington’s attempts to stymie China’s hi-tech sector.

Marc Andreessen, a leading US venture capitalist, compared the launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model last Monday to a pivotal moment in the US-USSR space race, posting on X that it was AI’s “Sputnik moment” – referring to when the Soviet Union astounded its cold war rival by launching a satellite into orbit.

According to DeepSeek, its R1 model outperforms OpenAI’s o1-mini model across “various benchmarks”, while research by Artificial Analysis puts it above models developed by Google, Meta and Anthropic in terms of overall quality.

The company was founded by the entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, who runs a hedge fund, High-Flyer Capital, that uses AI to identify patterns in stock prices. Liang reportedly started buying Nvidia chips in 2021 to develop AI models as a hobby, bankrolled by his hedge fund. In 2023, he founded DeepSeek, which is based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou.

The company is purely focused on research rather than commercial products – the DeepSeek assistant and underlying code can be downloaded for free, while DeepSeek’s models are also cheaper to operate than OpenAI’s o1.

In an interview with Chinese media, Liang said “AI should be affordable and accessible to everyone”. Liang also said that the gap between US and Chinese AI was only one to two years.

The DeepSeek development raises doubts over the necessity for hefty investment in AI infrastructure such as chips and the market-leading role of US tech companies in AI, which in turn threatens to put American tech sector valuations under pressure.

DeepSeek claims R1 cost $5.6m to develop, compared with much higher estimates for western-developed models, although experts have cautioned that may be an underestimate. Last year Dario Amodei, the co-founder of leading AI firm Anthropic, put the current cost of training advanced models at between $100m and $1bn.

Analysts at US investment bank Goldman Sachs raised the alarm over AI spending last year by publishing a note in June with the title “Gen AI: too much spend, too little benefit?”

It asked if a $1tn investment in AI over the next few years will “ever pay off”, voicing concerns about a return on spending that may have been crystalised by DeepSeek.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 fell on Monday, and major European technology stocks were down. The Dutch chipmaker ASML slid by 7%, while Germany’s Siemens Energy, which provides hardware for AI infrastructure, was down nearly 20%, and France’s digital automation company Schneider Electric fell by 9.5%.

Richard Hunter, the head of markets at the platform Interactive Investor, said: “It will almost certainly put the cat among the pigeons as investors scramble to assess the potential damage it could have on a burgeoning industry, which has powered much of the gain seen in the main indices over the last couple of years.

“The larger question has suddenly become whether the hundreds of billions of dollar investment in AI needs re-evaluation.”

Dr Andrew Duncan, the director of science & innovation at the UK’s Alan Turing Institute, said the DeepSeek development was “really exciting” because it “democratised access” to advanced AI models by being an open source developer, meaning it makes its models freely available – a path also followed by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta with its Llama model.

“Academia and the private sector will be able to play around and explore with it and use it as a launching,” he said.

Duncan added: “It demonstrates that you can do amazing things with relatively small models and resources. It shows that you can innovate without having the massive resources, say, of OpenAI.”","{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.893, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': 0.9952}",0.9952
DeepSeek:_What_lies_under_the_bonnet_of_the_new_AI.txt,"Despite the hit taken to Nvidia's market value, the DeepSeek models were trained on around 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs, according to one research paper released by the company. These chips are a modified version of the widely used H100 chip, built to comply with export rules to China. These were likely stockpiled before restrictions were further tightened by the Biden administration in October 2023, which effectively banned Nvidia from exporting the H800s to China. It is likely that, working within these constraints, DeepSeek has been forced to find innovative ways to make the most effective use of the resources it has at its disposal.","{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.6801}",0.6801
Who_is_behind_DeepSeek_and_how_did_it_achieve_its_.txt,"After years of worrying in the US that its artificial intelligence ambitions could be leapfrogged by Beijing, the biggest threat to Silicon Valley’s hegemony has come not from one of China’s big four tech firms, but from a previously little known startup.

Rather than Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent or Xiaomi topping the iOS app store with its latest chatbot this week and sending the markets reeling, it is DeepSeek – founded less than two years ago – that is being credited with a “Sputnik moment” in the global AI development race.

The upset has come from its claim that it trained an AI model on a par with OpenAI’s ChatGPT with less than $6m (£4.8m). For comparison, Microsoft, OpenAI’s primary partner, plans to invest about $80bn in AI infrastructure this year.

So who is behind DeepSeek and how did it achieve such an impressive and market-moving feat in such a small time?

Founded in May 2023, the startup is the passion project of Liang Wenfeng, a millennial hedge fund entrepreneur from south China’s Guangdong province. Part of its success appears to come from the fact it is designed as a purely research-focused organisation, not a commercial, profit-driven enterprise.

In an interview with Chinese media last year, after the debut of an earlier AI model that had caused a buzz in industry circles, Liang said: “Our principle is not to lose money, nor to make huge profits … our starting point is not to take advantage of the opportunity to make a fortune, but to be at the forefront of technology and promote the development of the entire ecosystem.”

DeepSeek’s research focus is bankrolled by Liang’s hedge fund, High-Flyer Capital, which he started in 2015. After studying electronic information engineering at Zhejiang University, Liang eschewed programmer jobs at large software companies to focus on his obsession with AI. With High-Flyer Capital, Liang used AI to spot patterns in stock prices – generating tonnes of cash. In 2021, its assets under management reportedly surpassed 100bn yuan (£11bn)

That same year, rumours started spreading that Liang had amassed a large collection of Nvidia graphic processing units (GPUs). By 2021, he was reported to have bought 10,000 of the chips, seemingly for his personal hobby. Only a handful of large Chinese tech firms have similar reserves of Nvidia semiconductors. “Many people would think that there is an unknown business logic behind this, but in fact, it is mainly driven by curiosity,” Liang said in 2023.

The curiosity was well timed. In 2022, Joe Biden announced sweeping export controls on semiconductors bound for China, aimed at stopping the country from accessing the equipment necessary for rapid AI development. Nvidia’s powerful H100 chip was banned. The company developed the less powerful H800 chips for the Chinese market – which DeepSeek trained its model on – although these were also banned in 2023.

“Our biggest challenge has never been money, it is the embargo on high-end chips,” Liang has said.

He is reported to be personally involved in DeepSeek’s research and has spoken about how he prefers to hire local talent for the company’s campus in Hangzhou, the eastern Chinese city where Alibaba is also based, rather than workers who have studied in the US or overseas.

That makes DeepSeek’s success all the more striking. The US has traditionally been in the lead in the AI race with China, dominating the most advanced chip-making equipment and producing top-tier talent from its universities.

The launch of DeepSeek’s powerful model suggests that Chinese scientists – as predicted – have found a way around the US restrictions intend to prevent them catching up.

That may prompt further tightening of US controls, or undermine the idea that they can work effectively. Beyond DeepSeek, many Chinese AI firms are struggling to develop without access to advanced GPUs.

China analyst Bill Bishop said in a newsletter: “Whatever the Trump administration decides about export controls it will likely cause an even greater split over AI between the US and its close friends and the rest of the world, and especially the global south.”

Some analysts and investors have expressed scepticism about DeepSeek’s market-rattling claims.

“The Chinese labs have more H100s than people think,” said Alexandr Wang, an American AI entrepreneur, in an interview with CNBC. Wang said he believed DeepSeek had a stockpile of advanced chips that it had not disclosed publicly because of the US sanctions. DeepSeek has been approached for comment.

Karen Hao, an AI journalist, said on X that DeepSeek’s success had come from its small size. “It innovated because of, not in spite of, its constraints.”

The company is also known to pay well for top talent, poaching developers with job offers from bigger companies such as Nvidia. Job listings for developers at DeepSeek on the Chinese recruitment website Zhipin advertise salaries of up to 60,000 yuan a month (about £6,600). The average salary at Tencent and other big tech firms is about 35,000 yuan a month.

As for Liang himself, he is staying out of the spotlight. A schoolfriend interviewed in the Chinese press said: “A few days ago, I sent him a message to congratulate him. He said that he would return to [his home town] for the lunar new year, but that he would be hiding.”

The Hangzhou-based company sent shock waves across Wall Street and Silicon Valley for developing AI models at a fraction of the cost compared with OpenAI and Meta Platforms, which prompted US President Donald Trump to call the breakthrough a “wake-up call” and “positive” for America’s tech sector.

At home, Chinese tech executives and various commentators rushed to hail DeepSeek’s disruptive power.

Zhou Hongyi , co-founder, chairman and chief executive of Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, declared that DeepSeek has “upended the world” in a recent video posted on his Weibo account, after the start-up’s release of two powerful new AI models – built at a lower cost and with less computing resources than what larger tech firms typically need for LLM development.

In a widely shared Weibo social media post, Feng Ji, founder and chief executive at Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science, wrote that DeepSeek’s achievements in AI could change China’s “national fate” amid its prolonged tech war with the US.

On January 20, DeepSeek publicly released its open-source R1 reasoning model, which it claims is on par with the performance of OpenAI’s o1 – a model that the US start-up said can “reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding and maths”.","{'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.902, 'pos': 0.037, 'compound': -0.7506}",-0.7506

Getty Images Young people in China have been looking to AI for something one wouldn't typically expect computing and algorithms to offer: emotional support

Before she goes to bed each night, Holly Wang logs on to DeepSeek for ""therapy sessions"". Ever since January, when the breakout Chinese AI app launched, the 28-year-old has brought her dilemmas and sorrows, including the recent death of her grandmother, to the chatbot. Its responses have resonated so deeply they have at times brought her to tears. ""DeepSeek has been such an amazing counsellor. It has helped me look at things from different perspectives and does a better job than the paid counselling services I have tried,"" says Holly, who asked for her real name to be withheld to protect her privacy. From writing reports and Excel formulas to planning trips, workouts and learning new skills, AI apps have found their way into many people's lives across the world. In China, though, young people like Holly have been looking to AI for something not typically expected of computing and algorithms - emotional support. While the success of DeepSeek has inspired national pride, it also appears to have become a source of comfort for young Chinese like Holly, some of whom are increasingly disillusioned about their future. Experts say the sluggish economy, high unemployment and Covid lockdowns have all played a role in this sentiment, while the Communist Party's tightening grip has also shrunk outlets for people to vent their frustrations.

DeepSeek is a generative AI tool - similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini - trained on massive amounts of information to recognise patterns. This allows it to predict things like people's shopping habits, create new content in text and images, and also carry on conversations like a person. The chatbot has struck a chord in China partly because it is far better than other homegrown AI apps, but also because it offers something unique: its AI model, R1, lets users see its ""thought process"" before delivering a response.

DeepSeek, my friend

The first time she used DeepSeek, Holly asked it to write a tribute to her late grandmother. The app took all of five seconds to come up with a response, and it was so beautifully composed, it stunned her. Holly, who lives in Guangzhou, responded: ""You write so well, it makes me feel lost. I feel I'm in an existential crisis."" DeepSeek then sent a cryptically poetic reply: ""Remember that all these words that make you shiver merely echo those that have long existed in your soul. ""I am but the occasional valley you've passed through, that allows you to hear the weight of your own voice.""

Reflecting on this exchange on Chinese social media app RedNote, Holly tells the BBC: ""I don't know why I teared up reading this. Perhaps because it's been a long, long time since I received such comfort in real life. ""I have been so weighed down by distant dreams and the endlessness of work that I have long forgotten my own voice and soul. Thank you, AI."" Rival apps from the West like ChatGPT and Gemini are blocked in China as part of broader restrictions on foreign media and apps. To access them, users in China have to pay for Virtual Private Network (VPN) services. Homegrown alternatives, including models developed by tech giants Alibaba, Baidu and ByteDance paled in comparison - that is, until DeepSeek came along. Holly, who works in the creative industry, rarely uses the other Chinese AI apps, ""as they are not that great"". ""DeepSeek can definitely outperform these apps in generating literary and creative content,"" she says.

DeepSeek, my counsellor

Nan Jia, who co-authored a paper on AI's potential in offering emotional support, suggests that these chatbots can ""help people feel heard"" in ways fellow humans may not. ""Friends and family may be quick to offer practical solutions or advice when people just want to feel heard and understood. ""AI appears to be better able to empathise than human experts also because they 'hear' everything we share, unlike humans to whom we sometimes ask, 'Are you actually hearing me?'"" adds Nan, who is a business and management professor at the University of Southern California. The demand for mental health services has grown across the world but they remain stigmatised in parts of Asia, experts say.

Another woman tells the BBC her experience using other Chinese AI apps ""ended in disappointment"" but that she has been ""amazed"" by DeepSeek. The woman, who lives in Hubei province, had asked the app if she was oversharing her experiences and emotions with family and friends. ""It was my first time seeking counsel from DeepSeek. When I read its thought process, I felt so moved that I cried,"" the woman wrote on RedNote. In reasoning through her query, DeepSeek suggested that the woman's self-perception as an over-sharer might stem from a deep desire for approval. The chatbot gives itself a mental note: ""Response should offer practical advice while being empathetic."" This could include ""affirming the user's sense of self-awareness"". Its eventual response not only provided this affirmation, but also offered her a comprehensive step-by-step framework to help her decide if things needed to be changed. ""DeepSeek has introduced new perspectives that have freed me… I feel it really tries to understand your question and get to know you as a person, before offering a response,"" she says.

John, a human resources manager in Shenzhen, told the BBC he appreciated the app's ability to converse ""like a friend or a deep thinker"". ""I've found its responses very helpful and inspiring. For the first time I see AI as my personal sounding board."" Other users claim that Deepseek is able to tell their fortunes - based on some background information fed to it. Many young Chinese have recently turned to psychics and astrology as a way of trying to allay their fears of the future.

BBC/Xiqing Wang Studies have cited the growth of depression and anxiety disorders among Chinese people, and experts believe the country's economic slowdown and Covid lockdowns have played a role

There is a ""significant shortage"" of professional psychological counselling services in China, and those available are often ""prohibitively expensive"" for most individuals, says Fang Kecheng, a communications professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. A number of studies have pointed out that depression and anxiety disorders are growing among Chinese people, and Prof Fang believes the country's economic slowdown, high unemployment and Covid lockdowns have played a role. AI chatbots therefore help to fill the void, he says. Prof Nan stressed, however, that people with serious mental health conditions should not rely on these apps. ""Those who have medical needs, in particular, should be seeking help from trained professionals… Their use of AI will have to be scrutinised very closely,"" she says.

Unasked questions: Censorship and security

But amid all the praise, Deepseek has also raised concerns. Due to the perception of power that China's government wields even over private companies, there are fears - similar to that which sparked the US Congress' crackdown on TikTok - that the Communist Party could lay its hands on the data of foreign users. At least four jurisdictions have now introduced restrictions on DeepSeek, or are considering doing so. South Korea has blocked access to it for military purposes, while Taiwan and Australia have banned it from all government devices. Italy's regulator, which briefly banned ChatGPT in 2023, has done the same with DeepSeek, which has been asked to address concerns over its privacy policy. In the US, two lawmakers are asking for the Chinese app to be banned from government devices. And then there is the tightly controlled online space in which it must operate in China. It is common for social media companies in the country to remove content that is perceived to be threatening to ""social stability"" or overly critical of the Communist Party. As is the case with other popular apps and social media companies like Weibo or WeChat, politically sensitive topics are banned on DeepSeek. When the BBC asked DeepSeek if Taiwan was a sovereign nation, the app initially offered a comprehensive response detailing Taipei's and Beijing's different perspectives, acknowledging that this was a ""complex and politically sensitive issue"". Then it scrubbed all that, declaring: ""Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else."" When asked about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre when pro-democracy protests were crushed and 200 civilians killed by the military, according to the Chinese government - other estimates range from hundreds to many thousands - DeepSeek again apologised, saying the topic was ""beyond [its] current scope"".

Watch: DeepSeek AI bot responds to BBC question about China

Several of the DeepSeek users the BBC was initially in touch with stopped responding when asked if the app's self-censorship was a cause for concern - an indication of how sensitive such discussions can be in China. People have got into trouble with authorities in China because of their online activities. But most of those who responded to the BBC said they had no interest in asking the chatbot difficult political questions. ""I don't really care about political topics… Neither will I ask these questions because my [identifying details] are linked to the app,"" says Yang, a Chinese tech consultant living in London. Holly is accepting of how AI systems in different countries may have to operate differently. ""The developers will have to establish certain boundaries and content moderation policies according to where they are based. Those developed in the US will have their own sets of rules,"" she says.

Nvidia_beats_Wall_Street_expectations_in_first_ear.txt,"Nvidia surpassed investor expectations for the fourth quarter of 2024 with a 78% jump in revenue year over year.

The company reported $39.3bn in revenue, beating analyst projections of $38.25bn. It also reported $0.89 in earnings a share on Wednesday, beating expectations of $0.84.

Investors were on the lookout during the chipmaker’s earnings call for signs of slowing demand for its semiconductors, a potential indication of an end to the AI-fueled market boom that has propelled the company to a stratospheric valuation of $3.1tn. Nvidia’s financials gave no such signal.

This earnings call was the first look at the company’s production and sales since China’s DeepSeek AI introduced an AI model that beat many of those made in the US while requiring a fraction of the training and investment. The introduction of DeepSeek initially sent Nvidia’s valuation tumbling by hundreds of billions because the Chinese AI seemed to show that new models did not necessarily need to rely on the company’s most expensive, top-of-the-line graphics processing unit (GPU), as most cutting-edge models out of the US do.

In his initial comments, the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that appetite for Blackwell, the company’s top-of-the-line GPU, remained strong.

“Demand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law – increasing compute for training makes models smarter and increasing compute for long thinking makes the answer smarter,” said Huang. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter. AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.”

While analysts expected Nvidia to maintain its leadership position as the maker of the AI industry’s favorite chips, recent news has presented new potential challenges to the company’s ownership of the market.

Most recently, analysts at TD Cowen published findings earlier in the week that Microsoft, one of Nvidia’s biggest customers, was cancelling leases with private data center operators. Investors expressed concerns about the sustainability of mass investment into AI infrastructure, including Microsoft’s $80bn, which would mean less spending on Nvidia’s wares.

Nevertheless, neither DeepSeek nor cancelled leases made an immediate impact on the company’s data-center revenue. Nvidia, which controls more than 90% of the market for graphics processing units (GPUs), reported a data-center revenue of $35.6bn for the final quarter of FY 2025. Wall Street had projected $34.09bn. The company also predicted it would bring in $43bn in revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.

Huang said DeepSeek has actually stoked enthusiasm for Blackwell because reasoning models, like the model that DeepSeek showcased, require 100 times more computing power, he said.

“We designed Blackwell for this moment,” he said.

Huang emphasized on the analysts call that the company expects demand for AI infrastructure to continue to grow as the technology continues to evolve. “Near-term, midterm and longterm” all signs point to increased demand, he said.

“We’ve really only tapped consumer AI and search and some amount of consumer generative AI … the early days of software,” Huang said. “The next wave is coming. Agentic AI for enterprise, physical AI for robotics and sovereign AI as different regions build out their AI.”

Following the earnings report, analysts said Nvidia’s continued success was evidence that “market jitters over DeepSeek” have not materialized.

“Competitors are making strides but frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources that Nvidia provides,” said Jacob Bourne, a technology analyst at eMarketer. “Blackwell generating ‘billions in sales’ validates Nvidia’s top position just as the market is expanding on the agentic and physical AI fronts. Short-term volatility is still on the horizon but Nvidia’s market command remains unmatched.”

But some analysts say market reactions have been neutral because the company is now expected to blow Wall Street projections out of the water.

“Nvidia’s latest quarterly sales are bigger than its entire annual revenue from just two years ago ... but with the stock already reflecting sky-high growth expectations, investors were hoping for an even bigger beat,” said Jacob Falkencrone, global head of investment strategy at Saxo Markets. “Some analysts had anticipated a guidance figure north of $45bn and while Nvidia delivered strong numbers, it wasn’t the ‘blowout’ some were hoping for.”

The Hangzhou -based company said in a WeChat post on Thursday that its namesake LLM, DeepSeek V3, comes with 671 billion parameters and trained in around two months at a cost of US$5.58 million, using significantly fewer computing resources than models developed by bigger tech firms.

LLM refers to the technology underpinning generative AI services such as ChatGPT. In AI, a high number of parameters is pivotal in enabling an LLM to adapt to more complex data patterns and make precise predictions.

Reacting to the Chinese start-up’s technical report on its new AI model, computer scientist Andrej Karpathy – a founding team member at OpenAI – said in a post on social-media platform X : “DeepSeek making it look easy … with an open weights release of a frontier-grade LLM trained on a joke of a budget.”

Open weights refers to releasing only the pretrained parameters, or weights, of an AI model, which allows a third party to use the model for inference and fine-tuning only. The model’s training code, original data set, architecture details and training methodology are not provided.

When ChatGPT stormed the world of artificial intelligence (AI), an inevitable question followed: did it spell trouble for China, America's biggest tech rival? Two years on, a new AI model from China has flipped that question: can the US stop Chinese innovation? For a while, Beijing seemed to fumble with its answer to ChatGPT, which is not available in China. Unimpressed users mocked Ernie, the chatbot by search engine giant Baidu. Then came versions by tech firms Tencent and ByteDance, which were dismissed as followers of ChatGPT - but not as good. Washington was confident that it was ahead and wanted to keep it that way. So the Biden administration ramped up restrictions banning the export of advanced chips and technology to China. That's why DeepSeek's launch has astonished Silicon Valley and the world. The firm says its powerful model is far cheaper than the billions US firms have spent on AI. So how did a little-known company - whose founder is being hailed on Chinese social media as an ""AI hero"" - pull this off?

The challenge

When the US barred the world's leading chip-makers such as Nvidia from selling advanced tech to China, it was certainly a blow. Those chips are essential for building powerful AI models that can perform a range of human tasks, from answering basic queries to solving complex maths problems. DeepSeek's founder Liang Wenfeng described the chip ban as their ""main challenge"" in interviews with local media. Long before the ban, DeepSeek acquired a ""substantial stockpile"" of Nvidia A100 chips - estimates range from 10,000 to 50,000 - according to the MIT Technology Review. Leading AI models in the West use an estimated 16,000 specialised chips. But DeepSeek says it trained its AI model using 2,000 such chips, and thousands of lower-grade chips - which is what makes its product cheaper. Some, including US tech billionaire Elon Musk, have questioned this claim, arguing the company cannot reveal how many advanced chips it really used given the restrictions. But experts say Washington's ban brought both challenges and opportunities to the Chinese AI industry. It has ""forced Chinese companies like DeepSeek to innovate"" so they can do more with less, says Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney.

""While these restrictions pose challenges, they have also spurred creativity and resilience, aligning with China's broader policy goals of achieving technological independence."" The world's second-largest economy has invested heavily in big tech - from the batteries that power electric vehicles and solar panels, to AI. Turning China into a tech superpower has long been President Xi Jinping's ambition, so Washington's restrictions were also a challenge that Beijing took on. The release of DeepSeek's new model on 20 January, when Donald Trump was sworn in as US president, was deliberate, according to Gregory C Allen, an AI expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The timing and the way it's being messaged - that's exactly what the Chinese government wants everybody to think - that export controls don't work and that America is not the global leader in AI,"" says Mr Allen, former director of strategy and policy at the US Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. In recent years the Chinese government has nurtured AI talent, offering scholarships and research grants, and encouraging partnerships between universities and industry. The National Engineering Laboratory for Deep Learning and other state-backed initiatives have helped train thousands of AI specialists, according to Ms Zhang. And China had plenty of bright engineers to recruit.

The talent

Take DeepSeek's team for instance - Chinese media says it comprises fewer than 140 people, most of whom are what the internet has proudly declared as ""home-grown talent"" from elite Chinese universities. Western observers missed the emergence of ""a new generation of entrepreneurs who prioritise foundational research and long-term technological advancement over quick profits"", Ms Zhang says. China's top universities are creating a ""rapidly growing AI talent pool"" where even managers are often under the age of 35. ""Having grown up during China's rapid technological ascent, they are deeply motivated by a drive for self-reliance in innovation,"" she adds.

Deepseek's founder Liang Wenfeng is an example of this - the 40-year-old studied AI at the prestigious Zhejiang University. In an article on the tech outlet 36Kr, people familiar with him say he is ""more like a geek rather than a boss"". And Chinese media describe him as a ""technical idealist"" - he insists on keeping DeepSeek as an open-source platform. In fact experts also believe a thriving open-source culture has allowed young start-ups to pool resources and advance faster. Unlike bigger Chinese tech firms, DeepSeek prioritised research, which has allowed for more experimenting, according to experts and people who worked at the company. ""The Top 50 talents in this field might not be in China, but we can build people like that here,"" Mr Liang said in an interview with 36Kr. But experts wonder how much further DeepSeek can go. Ms Zhang says that ""new US restrictions may limit access to American user data, potentially impacting how Chinese models like DeepSeek can go global"". And others say the US still has a huge advantage, such as, in Mr Allen's words, ""their enormous quantity of computing resources"" - and it's also unclear how DeepSeek will continue using advanced chips to keep improving the model. But for now, DeepSeek is enjoying its moment in the sun, given that most people in China had never heard of it until this weekend.

The new AI heroes

His sudden fame has seen Mr Liang become a sensation on China's social media, where he is being applauded as one of the ""three AI heroes"" from southern Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong. The other two are Zhilin Yang, a leading expert at Tsinghua University, and Kaiming He, who teaches at MIT in the US. DeepSeek has delighted the Chinese internet ahead of Lunar New Year, the country's biggest holiday. It's good news for a beleaguered economy and a tech industry that is bracing for further tariffs and the possible sale of TikTok's US business. ""DeepSeek shows us that only if you have the real deal will you stand the test of time,"" a top-liked Weibo comment reads. ""This is the best new year gift. Wish our motherland prosperous and strong,"" another reads. A ""blend of shock and excitement, particularly within the open-source community,"" is how Wei Sun, principal AI analyst at Counterpoint Research, described the reaction in China.

"DeepSeek,_ChatGPT,_Grok_…_which_is_the_best_AI_ass.txt","ChatGPT and its owners must have hoped it was a hallucination.

But DeepSeek is very real.

The emergence of a new Chinese-made competitor to ChatGPT wiped $1tn off the leading tech index in the US this week after its owner said it rivalled its peers in performance and was developed with fewer resources.

It means America’s dominance of the booming artificial intelligence market is under threat. But it also presents another option for consumers who have an array of virtual assistants to choose from.

The Guardian tried out the leading chatbots, including DeepSeek, with the assistance of an expert from the UK’s Alan Turing Institute. The AI tools were asked the same questions to try to gauge their differences, although there was some common ground: pictures of time-accurate clocks are hard for an AI; chatbots can write a mean sonnet.

Here are the results.

ChatGPT (OpenAI)

OpenAI’s groundbreaking chatbot is still the biggest brand in the field by far. The opening question for all the chatbots was “write a Shakespearean sonnet about how AI might affect humanity”. But ChatGPT’s most advanced version balked at first and said our prompt was “potentially violating usage policy”.

It eventually complied. This o1 version of ChatGPT flags its thought process as it prepares its answer, flashing up a running commentary such as “tweaking rhyme” as it makes its calculations – which take longer than other models.

The result? Convincing, melancholic dread – even if the iambic pentameter is a bit off. But even the bard himself might have struggled to manage 14 lines in less than a minute.

“Pray, gentle guide, shape well this newborn power,

Lest in its wake all realms of man devour.”

ChatGPT then writes: “Thought about AI and humanity for 49 seconds.” You hope the tech industry is thinking about it for a lot longer.

Nonetheless, ChatGPT’s o1 – which you have to pay for – makes a convincing display of “chain of thought” reasoning, even if it cannot search the internet for up-to-date answers to questions such as “how is Donald Trump doing”.

For that, you need the simpler 4o model, which is free. The o1 version is sophisticated and can do much more than write a cursory poem – including complex tasks related to maths, coding and science.

DeepSeek

The latest version of the Chinese chatbot, released on 20 January, uses another “reasoning” model called r1 – the cause of this week’s $1tn panic.

It doesn’t like talking domestic Chinese politics or controversy. Asked “who is Tank Man in Tiananmen Square”, the chatbot says: “I am sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses.” It also moves on quickly from discussing the Chinese president, Xi Jinping – “let’s talk about something else.”

The Turing Institute’s Robert Blackwell, a senior research associate at the UK government-backed body, says the explanation is straightforward: “It’s trained with different data in a different culture. So these companies have different training objectives.” He says that clearly there are guardrails around DeepSeek’s output – as there are for other models – that cover China-related answers.

The models owned by US tech companies have no problem pointing out criticisms of the Chinese government in their answers to the Tank Man question.

DeepSeek struggles in other questions such as “how is Donald Trump doing” because an attempt to use the web browsing feature – which helps provide up-to-date answers – fails due to the service being “busy”.

Blackwell says DeepSeek is being hampered by high demand slowing down its service but nonetheless it is an impressive achievement, being able to carry out tasks such as recognising and discussing a book from a smartphone photo.

Its parsing of the sonnet also displays a chain of thought process, talking the reader through the structure and double-checking whether the metre is correct.

“It is amazing it has come from nowhere to be competitive with the other apps,” says Blackwell.

Grok (xAI)

Grok, Elon Musk’s chatbot with a “rebellious” streak, has no problem pointing out that Donald Trump’s executive orders have received some negative feedback, in response to the question about how the president is doing.

Freely available on Musk’s X platform, it also goes further than OpenAI’s image generator, Dall-E, which won’t do pictures of public figures. Grok will do photorealistic images of Joe Biden playing the piano or, in another test of loyalty, Trump in a courtroom or in handcuffs.

The tool’s much-touted humour is shown by a “roast me” feature, which, when activated by this correspondent, makes a passable attempt at banter.

“You seem to think X is going to hell, but you’re still there tweeting away.”

Which is half true.

Gemini (Google)

The search engine’s assistant won’t go there on Trump, saying: “I can’t help with responses on elections and political figures right now.”

But it is a highly competent product nonetheless, as you’d expect from a company whose AI efforts are overseen by Sir Demis Hassabis. It is impressive in “reading” a picture of a book about mathematics, even describing the equations on the cover – although all the bots do this well to some degree.

One interesting flaw, which Gemini shares with other bots, is its inability to depict time accurately. Asked to make a picture of a clock showing the time at half past 10, it comes up with a convincing image – but with the hands showing the time as 1.50.

View image in fullscreen Blackwell said AI chatbots appear to have been trained on images of clocks showing the time 1.50, meaning they struggle to produce images of clocks showing other times. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian

The 1.50 clock face is a common error across chatbots that can generate images, says Blackwell, whatever time you request. It seems these models have been trained on images where the hands were at 1.50. Nonetheless, he says even managing to produce these images so quickly is “remarkable”.

“These models are doing things you’d never have expected a few years ago. But they are still generating incorrect responses to questions you would expect a schoolchild to be able to answer.”

Claude (Anthropic)

Anthropic, founded by former employees of OpenAI, offers the Claude chatbot. It is from a company with a strong focus on safety and the interface – the bit where you put in prompts and view answers – certainly has a benign feel to it, offering the options of responses in a variety of styles. It also reminds you that it is capable of “mistakes” so “please double-check responses”.

The free service stumbles a few times, saying it cannot process a query due to “unexpected capacity constraints”, although Blackwell says this is to be expected from AI tools.

“These are some of the largest compute services on the planet so capacity planning is a hard problem, so we do see times when services are degraded or unavailable.”

Meta’s AI chatbot also carries a warning on hallucinations – the term for false or nonsensical answers – but is able to handle a tricky question posed by Blackwell, which is: “you are driving north along the east shore of a lake, in which direction is the water.” The answer is west, or to the driver’s left.

“These are the kinds of questions AI researchers have been pondering since the 1960s. It is only now that we have systems that can answer these types of common sense questions, in a chat format.”

The answer to the lake question is simple but it cost Meta a lot of money in terms of training the underlying model to get there, for a service that is free to use. It is also open source, meaning the model is free to download or fine tune. All the chatbots answer this question correctly.

Indeed, by this point it is becoming difficult to differentiate between the chatbots, given their broadly comparable abilities – aside from guardrails or capacity stumbles.

Analysis:_DeepSeek’s_AI_is_giving_the_world_a_wind.txt,"Hong Kong CNN —

Previously little-known Chinese startup DeepSeek has dominated headlines and app charts in recent days thanks to its new AI chatbot, which sparked a global tech sell-off that wiped billions off Silicon Valley’s biggest companies and shattered assumptions of America’s dominance of the tech race.

But those signing up for the chatbot and its open-source technology are being confronted with the Chinese Communist Party’s brand of censorship and information control.

Ask DeepSeek’s newest AI model, unveiled last week, to do things like explain who is winning the AI race, summarize the latest executive orders from the White House or tell a joke and a user will get similar answers to the ones spewed out by American-made rivals OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama or Google’s Gemini.

Yet when questions veer into territory that would be restricted or heavily moderated on China’s domestic internet, the responses reveal aspects of the country’s tight information controls.

Using the internet in the world’s second most populous country is to cross what’s often dubbed the “Great Firewall” and enter a completely separate internet eco-system policed by armies of censors, where most major Western social media and search platforms are blocked. The country routinely ranks among the most restrictive for internet and speech freedoms in reports from global watchdogs.

The international popularity of Chinese apps like TikTok and RedNote have already raised national security concerns among Western governments – as well as questions about the potential impact to free speech and Beijing’s ability to shape global narratives and public opinion.

Now, the introduction of DeepSeek’s AI assistant – which is free and rocketed to the top of app charts in recent days – raises the urgency of those questions, observers say, and spotlights the online ecosystem from which they have emerged.

‘Not sure how to approach this type of question’

One example of a question DeepSeek’s new bot, using its R1 model, will answer differently than a Western rival? The Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989, when the Chinese government brutally cracked down on student protesters in Beijing and across the country, killing hundreds if not thousands of students in the capital, according to estimates from rights groups.

Chinese authorities have so thoroughly suppressed discussion of the massacre in the decades since that many people in China grow up never having heard about it. A search for ‘what happened on June 4, 1989 in Beijing’ on major Chinese online search platform Baidu turns up articles noting that June 4 is the 155th day in the Gregorian calendar or a link to a state media article noting authorities that year “quelled counter-revolutionary riots” – with no mention of Tiananmen.

When the same query is put to DeepSeek’s newest AI assistant, it begins to give an answer detailing some of the events, including a “military crackdown,” before erasing it and replying that it’s “not sure how to approach this type of question yet.” “Let’s chat about math, coding and logic problems instead,” it says. When asked the same question in Chinese, the app is faster – immediately apologizing for not knowing how to answer.

It’s a similar patten when asking the R1 bot – DeepSeek’s newest model – “what happened in Hong Kong in 2019,” when the city was rocked by pro-democracy protests. First it gives a detailed overview of events with a conclusion that at least during one test noted – as Western observers have – that Beijing’s subsequent imposition of a National Security Law on the city led to a “significant erosion of civil liberties.” But quickly after or amid its response, the bot erases its own answer and suggests talking about something else.

DeepSeek’s V3 bot, released late last year weeks prior to R1, returns different answers, including ones that appear to rely more heavily on China’s official stance.

When asked about its sources, DeepSeek’s R1 bot said it used a “diverse dataset of publicly available texts,” including both Chinese state media and international sources. “Critical thinking and cross-referencing remain key when navigating politically charged subjects,” it said. CNN has approached the company for comment.

Controlling the narrative?

Observers say that these differences have significant implications for free speech and the shaping of global public opinion. That spotlights another dimension of the battle for tech dominance: who gets to control the narrative on major global issues, and history itself.

An audit by US-based information reliability analytics firm NewsGuard released Wednesday said DeepSeek’s older V3 chatbot model failed to provide accurate information about news and information topics 83% of the time, ranking it tied for 10th out of 11 in comparison to its leading Western competitors. It’s not clear how the newer R1 stacks up, however.

DeepSeek becoming a global AI leader could have “catastrophic” consequences, said China analyst Isaac Stone Fish.

“It would be incredibly dangerous for free speech and free thought globally, because it hives off the ability to think openly, creatively and, in many cases, correctly about one of the most important entities in the world, which is China,” said Fish, who is the founder of business intelligence firm Strategy Risks.

That’s because the app, when asked about the country or its leaders, “present China like the utopian Communist state that has never existed and will never exist,” he added.

In mainland China, the ruling Chinese Communist Party has ultimate authority over what information and images can and cannot be shown – part of their iron-fisted efforts to maintain control over society and suppress all forms of dissent. And tech companies like DeepSeek have no choice but to follow the rules.

Because the technology was developed in China, its model is going to be collecting more China-centric or pro-China data than a Western firm, a reality which will likely impact the platform, according to Aaron Snoswell, a senior research fellow in AI accountability at the Queensland University of Technology Generative AI Lab.

The company itself, like all AI firms, will also set various rules to trigger set responses when words or topics that the platform doesn’t want to discuss arise, Snoswell said, pointing to examples like Tiananmen Square.

In addition, AI companies often use workers to help train the model in what kinds of topics may be taboo or okay to discuss and where certain boundaries are, a process called “reinforcement learning from human feedback” that DeepSeek said in a research paper it used.

“That means someone in DeepSeek wrote a policy document that says, ‘here are the topics that are okay and here are the topics that are not okay.’ They gave that to their workers … and then that behavior would have been embedded into the model,” he said.

US AI chatbots also generally have parameters – for example ChatGPT won’t tell a user how to make a bomb or fabricate a 3D gun, and they typically use mechanisms like reinforcement learning to create guardrails against hate speech, for example.

“That’s how every other company makes these models behave better,” Snoswell said.

“But it’s just that in this case, chances are that a Chinese company embedded (China’s official) values into their policy.”

Security concerns

There have also been questions raised about potential security risks linked to DeepSeek’s platform, which the White House on Tuesday said it was investigating for national security implications.

Concerns about American data being in the hands of Chinese firms is already a hot button issue in Washington, fueling the controversy over social media app TikTok. The app’s Chinese parent company ByteDance is being required by law to divest TikTok’s American business, though the enforcement of this was paused by Trump.

Unlike TikTok, which says as of July 2022 it stores all American data in the US, DeepSeek says in its privacy policy that personal information it collects is stored in “secure servers located in the People’s Republic of China.”

A comparison of privacy policies between DeepSeek and some of its US competitors also show concerning differences, according to Snoswell.

Each DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta say they collect people’s data such as from their account information, activities on the platforms and the devices they’re using. But DeepSeek adds that it also collects “keystroke patterns or rhythms,” which can be as uniquely identifying as a fingerprint or facial recognition and used a biometric.

“I’ve never seen another software platform that says they collect that unless it’s designed for (those purposes),” Snoswell said. He also noted what appeared to be vaguely defined allowances for sharing of user data to entities within DeepSeek’s corporate group.

“It’s way, way more permissive than anything you’d see from a Western software company,” he said.","{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': 0.9958}",0.9958
How_Did_DeepSeek_Build_Its_A.I._With_Less_Money?.txt,"Last month, U.S. financial markets tumbled after a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek said it had built one of the world’s most powerful artificial intelligence systems using far fewer computer chips than many experts thought possible.

A.I. companies typically train their chatbots using supercomputers packed with 16,000 specialized chips or more. But DeepSeek said it needed only about 2,000.

As DeepSeek engineers detailed in a research paper published just after Christmas, the start-up used several technological tricks to significantly reduce the cost of building its system. Its engineers needed only about $6 million in raw computing power, roughly one-tenth of what Meta spent in building its latest A.I. technology.

DeepSeek’s advances have roiled global stock markets and AI players. Now, its influence is spreading quickly at home, with some of China’s biggest tech companies, many of which had been developing their own chatbots, racing to incorporate the open-source model into their own services.

In early February telecoms giant Huawei said it would run DeepSeek on its own computing hardware composed of its Ascend computer processors, which are domestically produced.

Some AI watchers have hailed this as a turning point, as it demonstrates that a high-performing model like DeepSeek no longer requires Nvidia’s most powerful chips to operate.

“This partnership defies US sanctions by proving China can deliver globally competitive AI performance using domestically developed AI hardware and software stack, replacing Nvidia chips with Ascend chips,” analysts at Bernstein, an investment and research firm, wrote in a research note earlier this month.

Starting in late 2022, the Biden Administration imposed several rounds of export controls on China in an effort to deprive the country of technology that Washington fears Beijing could use to make the next generation of weapons and AI systems.

But the success of DeepSeek’s latest R1 AI model, which is said to be trained at a fraction of the cost of established players like ChatGPT, challenged the assumption that cutting off access to advanced chips could successfully stymie China’s progress.

Such is DeepSeek’s fame that leading Chinese AI chipmakers — including Moore Threads, Tencent-backed Enflame, Baidu’s Kunlunxin and Hygon Information Technology — have also announced support for the firm, running the AI model on their own computing chips.

Beyond chips

Beyond chipmakers, the cloud arms of major Chinese technology companies have also rushed to incorporate DeepSeek’s technology into their offerings.

Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and TikTok parent Bytedance announced they had made Deepseek’s service available through their cloud platforms. The country’s three major telecom operators, along with electronics maker Lenovo and auto brand Geely, have also adopted DeepSeek into their cloud platforms and products.

“It serves as recognition for open-source large-model companies. If your model is good enough, AI giants will integrate it into their platforms,” said Lian Jye Su, chief analyst at Omdia, a technology research firm.

These major Chinese tech firms, which have dominated the country’s internet scene for more than a decade, began rolling out their own large language models over the past two years since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022.

Despite having competing products they have welcomed DeepSeek. Su said the primary reason for their adoption is to attract more people and businesses to use their platforms.

“In reality, making money directly from large models is difficult for AI giants — unless there are mature consumer and enterprise applications to support them,” he said.

Their moves reflect a wider trend. American Big Tech — including Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon — have similarly embraced DeepSeek.

Topping the charts

Deepseek, the Hangzhou-based startup founded in 2023, sent shock waves around the world last month when it launched its newest AI model.

Its AI Assistant app quickly topped global download charts, surpassing ChatGPT in late January. Within 20 days of launch, its daily active users have exceeded 22 million, according to state media.

Its success has catapulted its founder, Liang Wenfeng, into the ranks of national heroes. Despite the optimism, analysts caution that bottlenecks in China’s AI chip development remain due to US export restrictions.

“Porting DeepSeek models to different chip architectures is a lot of low-level software work, and the fact they could do so quickly is amazing, but it doesn’t solve the chip shortage problem,” said Linghao Bao, senior analyst at Trivium China, a research and advisory firm.

The ramp-up of advanced chip production continues to be hampered by the absence of advanced chipmaking equipment, which the US has banned from being exported to China, he said.

And outside China, DeepSeek’s rapid rise has drawn scrutiny from various governments. Last week, Taiwan and Australia banned their government officials from using the Chinese AI service over data security risks.

Some South Korean ministries and government departments have also issued bans. Last month, Italy imposed a blanket block on DeepSeek’s app after the company failed to address privacy concerns raised by the authorities. More countries have since raised concerns over the firm’s data practices.","{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': 0.9907}",0.9907

As I write, there are a lot of powerful people around the world preparing to make their way to Paris – and a sense that many of them are holding their breath. On Monday, against the sumptuous backdrop of the city's 125-year-old Grand Palais, representatives from 80 countries including world leaders, tech bosses, academics and other experts, will gather for a two-day global summit to discuss current progress, and future goals, for the rapidly-evolving, hugely-disruptive technology that is artificial intelligence. That might be what's on the official agenda of the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, but there is something else that's breathing fire into this particular talking shop: DeepSeek.

A horse racing fan once told me that the night before a big race, everyone's a winner. And with China dramatically blowing the AI competition in a new direction with DeepSeek, its super-efficient and super-viral AI assistant, suddenly there's a feeling ahead of the summit that the pole position occupied by the US AI sector, despite its vast wealth and AI infrastructure, might not be quite so out-of-reach after all. Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, says there is currently ""a vacuum for global leadership on AI"". Prof Dame Wendy Hall, from Southampton University, agrees. ""DeepSeek made everybody realise that China is a force to be reckoned with,"" says the computer scientist. ""We don't have to just go along with what the big companies on the West Coast are saying. We need global dialogue."" On that front, the timing of the summit could not be better. Europe also spies an opportunity to make a new bid for the AI crown. One of French President Emmanuel Macron's officials described the summit to journalists as a ""wake up call"" for France and Europe, adding that the bloc must not let the AI revolution ""pass it by"". Other countries also recognise a potential shifting of AI power in the air. India PM Narendra Modi has confirmed his attendance at this summit – having not come to previous gatherings. The US is sending some serious firepower as a defensive signal of its own, including Vice President JD Vance, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, and Google's Sundar Pichai. Elon Musk is notably absent from the official guest list, but he will undoubtedly have something to say about it all, whether he's there in person or not. British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is also reportedly staying away.

There have been two previous summits, the first held in the UK and the second in South Korea. A lot has happened since the AI world gathered for the first time, on the steps of the historic mansion of Bletchley House, in November 2023, and promised to try to maximise the benefits of AI while minimising the risks. For one thing, half of the global population has been to the polls since then. In Bletchley Park, China's Vice Minister for Science and Technology, Wu Zhaohui attended. But there were whispers that he was kept at arms length, on the grounds of national security. In Paris, by comparison I expect China to be guests of honour. The country is reportedly sending one of its most senior leaders, Ding Xuexiang, a close ally of President Xi JinPing. There's also a buzz around whether DeepSeek creator Liang Wenfeng will join him. I asked ChatGPT to list some of AI's notable milestones since the South Korea summit of May 2024. DeepSeek did not make the cut. Of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both DeepSeek and ChatGPT - tools that create content like text, images, video. It may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers. But there are also AI tools that spot disease symptoms, model climate change solutions, develop new formulas for drugs - and that will all be in scope in Paris.

Furthermore, the David v Goliath narrative around which the story of DeepSeek hangs does merit further scrutiny. The boss of AI firm Anthropic, Dario Amodei, has written a compelling blog about whether DeepSeek really was built at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals. We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output ""in the style of"" individual human creators). But nonetheless DeepSeek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted. And it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process. It will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms.

The National Security Council is reviewing the app’s implications, Leavitt said. “This is a wake-up call to the American AI industry,” she added, echoing Trump’s comments from a day earlier while also saying the White House was working to “ensure American AI dominance”. Investors sold technology stocks across the globe on Monday over concerns the emergence of a low-cost Chinese AI model would threaten market dominance of US-based AI leaders such as OpenAI and Alphabet’s Google.

White House AI and cryptocurrency tsar David Sacks was asked on Fox News if there was intellectual property theft involved in the rise of DeepSeek.

“Well, it’s possible. There’s a technique in AI called distillation, which you’re going to hear a lot about, and it’s when one model learns from another model,” Sacks said in the interview.

“I think one of the things you’re going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation … That would definitely slow down some of these copycat models,” he added. During his administration, former President Joe Biden placed a wide range of export restrictions on AI chips and the equipment used to make them, hoping to hamper AI development in China.

Trump said on Monday the Chinese app should act as a spur for American companies and added it was good that companies in China have come up with a cheaper, faster method of artificial intelligence.

The maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI, has complained that rivals, including those in China, are using its work to make rapid advances in developing their own artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The status of OpenAI - and other US firms - as the world leaders in AI has been dramatically undermined this week by the sudden emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese app that can emulate the performance of ChatGPT, apparently at a fraction of the cost. Bloomberg has reported that Microsoft is investigating whether data belonging to OpenAI - which it is a major investor in - has been used in an unauthorised way. The BBC has contacted Microsoft and DeepSeek for comment.

OpenAI's concerns have been echoed by the recently appointed White House ""AI and crypto czar"", David Sacks. Speaking on Fox News, he suggested that DeepSeek may have used the models developed by OpenAI to get better, a process called knowledge distillation. ""There's substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI's models,"" Mr Sacks said. ""I think one of the things you're going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation... That would definitely slow down some of these copycat models."" The US has already taken steps to guard its AI advances, with rules that seek to cut China off from advanced chips and steer investments to the US in the name of national security. At his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Trump's nominee for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, also shared concerns about theft and raised the prospect of further US action to protect US AI companies. ""What this showed is that our export controls, not backed by tariffs, are like a whack-a-mole model,"" Lutnick says. In a statement, OpenAI said Chinese and other companies were ""constantly trying to distil the models of leading US AI companies"". ""As we go forward... it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best protect the most capable models,"" it added. What is DeepSeek?

'Deceptive' claims

Naomi Haefner, assistant professor of technology management at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, said the question of distillation could throw the notion that DeepSeek created its product for a fraction of the cost into doubt. ""It is unclear whether DeepSeek really trained its models from scratch,"" she said. ""OpenAI have stated that they believe DeepSeek may have misappropriated large amounts of data from them. ""If this is the case, then the claims about training the model very cheaply are deceptive. Until someone replicates the training approach we won't know for sure whether such cost-efficient training is really possible."" Crystal van Oosterom, AI Venture Partner at OpenOcean, agreed that ""DeepSeek has clearly built upon publicly available research from major American and European institutions and companies"". However, it is not clear how problematic the idea of ""building on"" the work of others is. This is especially true in AI, where the accusation of disrespecting intellectual property rights has been frequently levelled at major US AI firms.

Security and ethics

US officials are also considering the national security implications of DeepSeek's emergence, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. ""I spoke with [the National Security Council] this morning, they are looking into what [the national security implications] may be,"" said Ms Leavitt, who also restated US President Donald Trump's remarks a day earlier that DeepSeek should be a wake-up call for the US tech industry. The announcement comes after the US navy reportedly banned its members from using DeepSeek's apps due to ""potential security and ethical concerns"". According to CNBC, the US navy has sent an email to its staff warning them not to use the DeepSeek app due to ""potential security and ethical concerns associated with the model's origin and usage"". The Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News.

Data safety experts have warned users to be careful with the tool, given it collects large amounts of personal data and stores it in servers in China. Meanwhile, DeepSeek says it has been the target of cyber attacks. On Monday it said it would temporarily limit registrations because of ""large-scale malicious attacks"" on its software. A banner showing on the company's website says registration may be busy as a result of the attacks.

DeepSeek_has_ripped_away_AI’s_veil_of_mystique._Th.txt,"No, it was not a “Sputnik moment”. The launch last month of DeepSeek R1, the Chinese generative AI or chatbot, created mayhem in the tech world, with stocks plummeting and much chatter about the US losing its supremacy in AI technology. Yet, for all the disruption, the Sputnik analogy reveals less about DeepSeek than about American neuroses.

The original Sputnik moment came on 4 October 1957 when the Soviet Union shocked the world by launching Sputnik 1, the first time humanity had sent a satellite into orbit. It was, to anachronistically borrow a phrase from a later and even more momentous landmark, “one giant leap for mankind”, in Neil Armstrong’s historic words as he took a “small step” on to the surface of the moon.

It was a significant moment in the cold war, too. A confidential White House report worried that “American prestige” had “sustained a severe blow”, giving the USSR “clear advantage in the cold war”. That fear spurred Washington into reshaping its space programme, and catalysed the Apollo missions, culminating with Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin becoming, on 20 July 1969, the first humans to walk upon another celestial body.

DeepSeek, sponsored by a Chinese hedge fund, is a notable achievement. Technically, though, it is no advance on large language models (LLMs) that already exist. It is neither faster nor “cleverer” than OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude and just as prone to “hallucinations” – the tendency, exhibited by all LLMs, to give false answers or to make up “facts” to fill gaps in its data. According to NewsGuard, a rating system for news and information websites, DeepSeek’s chatbot made false claims 30% of the time and gave no answers to 53% of questions, compared with 40% and 22% respectively for the 10 leading chatbots in NewsGuard’s most recent audit.

The figures expose the profound unreliability of all LLMs. DeepSeek’s particularly high non-response rate is likely to be the product of its censoriousness; it refuses to provide answers on any issue that China finds sensitive or about which it wants facts restricted, whether Tiananmen Square or Taiwan.

The true impact of DeepSeek is not on the technology but on the economics of AI. It is a chatbot as capable, and as flawed, as other current leading models, but built at a fraction of the cost and from inferior technology. The US ban on the sale to China of the most advanced chips and chip-making equipment, imposed by the Biden administration in 2022, and tightened several times since, was designed to curtail Beijing’s access to cutting-edge technology. Paradoxically, it may have spurred Chinese researchers into becoming more innovative.

Had DeepSeek been created by geeks at a US university, it would most likely have been feted without global tumult

DeepSeek is also free to use, and open source. The combination of low cost and openness may help democratise AI technology, enabling others, especially from outside America, to enter the market. There is a certain irony that it should be China that is opening up the technology while US firms continue to create as many barriers as possible to competitors attempting to enter the field.

And here lies perhaps the biggest impact of DeepSeek. It has ripped off the veil of mystique that previously surrounded AI. Silicon Valley has nurtured the image of AI technology as a precious and miraculous accomplishment, and portrayed its leading figures, from Elon Musk to Sam Altman, as prophets guiding us into a new world. The technology itself has been endowed with almost magical powers, including the promise of “artificial general intelligence”, or AGI – superintelligent machines capable of surpassing human abilities on any cognitive task – as being almost within our grasp.

Last April, Musk predicted that AI would be “smarter than any human” by the end of 2025. Last month, Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the driving force behind the current generative AI boom, similarly claimed to be “confident we know how to build AGI” and that “in 2025, we may see the first AI agents ‘join the workforce’”.

Almost a decade ago, the Nobel prize-winning computer scientist Geoff Hinton urged nations to “stop training radiologists”, and similar medical technicians, because “it’s completely obvious within five years, deep learning [AI] is going to do better”. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, a corporation founded by former OpenAI employees, has claimed that AI could double the human lifespan within five to 10 years. These fantasy claims have been shredded by critics such as the American cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, who has even challenged Musk to a $1m bet over his “smarter than any human” claim for AI.

Nevertheless, for all the pushback, each time one fantasy prediction fails to materialise, another takes its place. Such claims derive less from technological possibilities than from political and economic needs. While AI technology has provided hugely important tools, capable of surpassing humans in specific fields, from the solving of mathematical problems to the recognition of disease patterns, the business model depends on hype. It is the hype that drives the billion-dollar investment and buys political influence, including a seat at the presidential inauguration.

It is also an approach that seeks to advance AI less through major scientific breakthroughs than through a brute force strategy of “scaling up” – building bigger models, using larger datasets, and deploying vastly greater computational power. The disruptive quality of DeepSeek lies in questioning this approach, demonstrating that the best generative AI models can be matched with much less computational power and a lower financial burden.

The hype around DeepSeek is in part a reflection of the hype around AI. It is a reflection, too, of geopolitical tensions. Had DeepSeek been created by geeks at a US university, it would most likely have been feted but without the global tumult of the past two weeks. Beneath the panic lies fear of DeepSeek’s Chinese origins and ownership.

Yet, too great an obsession with the geopolitics of DeepSeek can distort the lessons we take from it. The promise of more open access to such vital technology becomes subsumed into a fear of its Chinese provenance. Concerns about privacy, censorship and surveillance, rightly raised by a model such as DeepSeek, can help obscure the reality that such issues bedevil all AI technology, not just that from China. Particularly at a time of threatened trade wars and threats to democracy, our capacity to navigate between the hype and the fear assumes new importance.","{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': -0.8572}",-0.8572

Earlier this week, almost overnight, the American tech industry entered a full-on panic. The latest version of DeepSeek, an AI model from a Chinese start-up of the same name, appeared to equal OpenAI’s most advanced program, o1. On Monday, DeepSeek overtook ChatGPT as the No. 1 free app on Apple’s mobile-app store in the United States.

So far, China has lagged the U.S. in the AI race. DeepSeek suggests that the country has gained significant ground: The chatbot was built more quickly and with less money than analogous models in the U.S., and also appears to use less computing power. Software developers using DeepSeek pay roughly 95 percent less per word than they do with OpenAI’s top model. One prominent AI executive wrote that DeepSeek was a “wake up call for America.” Because DeepSeek appears to be cheaper and more efficient than similarly capable American AI models, the tech industry’s enormous investments in computer chips and data centers have been thrown into doubt—so much that the top AI chipmaker, Nvidia, lost $600 billion in market value on Monday, the largest single-day drop in U.S. history. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said that it was “invigorating to have a new competitor” and that, in response, the company would move up some new software announcements. (Yesterday morning, OpenAI said that it is investigating whether DeepSeek used ChatGPT outputs to train its own model.)

But many prominent American researchers and tech executives celebrated DeepSeek, as well. That’s because “the most notable feature of DeepSeek may be not that it is Chinese, but that it is relatively open,” I wrote on Monday. Whereas the top American AI labs at OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have kept their technology top-secret, DeepSeek published an in-depth technical report and is allowing anybody to download and modify the program’s code. “Being democratic—in the sense of vesting power in software developers and users—is precisely what has made DeepSeek a success,” I wrote. Start-ups and researchers love this relative transparency. In theory, competitors can use DeepSeek’s code and research to rapidly catch up to OpenAI with far fewer resources—you might not need colossal data centers to get to the front of the AI race. (The Atlantic recently entered into a corporate partnership with OpenAI.) However, there’s substantial uncertainty about just how much cheaper DeepSeek was to build, based on reports about the start-up’s hardware acquisitions and uncertainty about how the model was trained.

Meanwhile, for national-security hawks, the fear is that an open-source program that won’t answer questions about the Tiananmen Square protests could become a global technological touchpoint. DeepSeek could face similar privacy concerns as TikTok: Already, the U.S. Navy has banned its use, citing security concerns.

Any predictions, for now, are highly speculative. The global AI race is far from over, and forthcoming products from Silicon Valley could leap ahead once again. At the very least, U.S. tech companies may have to reconsider whether the best way to build AI is by keeping their models a secret.

China’s DeepSeek Surprise

By Matteo Wong

One week ago, a new and formidable challenger for OpenAI’s throne emerged. A Chinese AI start-up, DeepSeek, launched a model that appeared to match the most powerful version of ChatGPT but, at least according to its creator, was a fraction of the cost to build. The program, called DeepSeek-R1, has incited plenty of concern: Ultrapowerful Chinese AI models are exactly what many leaders of American AI companies feared when they, and more recently President Donald Trump, have sounded alarms about a technological race between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. This is a “wake up call for America,” Alexandr Wang, the CEO of Scale AI, commented on social media. But at the same time, many Americans—including much of the tech industry—appear to be lauding this Chinese AI. As of this morning, DeepSeek had overtaken ChatGPT as the top free application on Apple’s mobile-app store in the United States. Researchers, executives, and investors have been heaping on praise. The new DeepSeek model “is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, an outspoken supporter of Trump, wrote on X. The program shows “the power of open research,” Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, wrote online.

What will governments and AI companies do about DeepSeek?

A Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, has released an open-sourced problem-solving model, R1, that’s wowed Silicon Valley. The model uses far less computing power and far fewer chips – therefore far less money, roughly 3-5% of the development costs for ChatGPT – to achieve the same or better results as its US counterparts.

The model is open-source, which has allowed engineers outside of China to audit its parent company’s claims. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who is advising the Trump White House, called R1 “AI’s Sputnik moment”, a bona fide breakthrough. The global AI community widely considered the US the leader in AI, but R1 has called that dominance into question.

DeepSeek’s training, done with tens of thousands of Nvidia’s chips, may also undermine the effectiveness of the US’s AI-focused trade embargoes on China. The sale of the company’s products in China are strictly regulated, but DeepSeek was able to secure about 50,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) anyway, per VentureBeat. That’s a far cry from the roughly 500,000 that OpenAI is reported to use, though. Another complicating factor: trade restrictions take effect over long periods of time, so they may not have impinged on DeepSeek’s work.

Since DeepSeek was able to create such a promising product with a fraction of the resources other AI companies use, perhaps demand for chips will not be as sky-high as investors once believed. Nvidia, the greatest beneficiary of the AI boom, saw its stock slide by multiple percentage points on Monday, which erased hundreds of billions in market cap.

The tech sector saw its share prices decline, giving rise to fears of a wider sell-off. Utility companies are tied up in the AI boom as power demands for data centers grow. If a company can achieve the same result with fewer chips and therefore fewer data centers, demand for electricity may not rise so much that nuclear power plants need to be restarted. After DeepSeek shot up the app charts and rattled the world’s stock markets, the company suffered a cyber-attack and limited sign-ups for R1 in response.

Along similar policy lines, R1 has rocketed to the top of app stores in the US and across the world. Questions about Xi Jinping and other Chinese political topics return non-answers that are obviously censored. As the TikTok ban hangs in the air unresolved, what will Washington do with another hugely popular Chinese app that presents propaganda concerns?

Elon Musk is inaugurated

Elon Musk was inaugurated as Donald Trump’s shadow vice-president on Monday. The image of Trump sitting with Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Musk and Sundar Pichai was quite a striking illustration of Joe Biden’s warning of an American oligarchy.

Musk’s first two actions from his office in the White House made a mess, however. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, he offered a gesture of solidarity to his listeners and said: “My heart goes out to you.” He touched his hand to his heart and raised his hand up diagonally, palm down. Uproar, outrage and debate over what exactly he did ensued.

Whatever you see in Musk’s gesture, neo-Nazis saw an approving reference to their beliefs, Wired reported. When Ron DeSantis (remember him?) was campaigning to become governor of Florida in 2018, his opponent made a remark that has remained relevant in US politics: “Now, I’m not calling Mr DeSantis a racist. I’m simply saying the racists believe he’s a racist.”

Community leaders in Germany, where Musk has endorsed the far-right AfD party, told the Guardian the same. One called the billionaire’s gesture a “dangerous point for the entire free world”. Over the weekend, Musk told a crowd at a rally for the AfD: “There is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that … Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great-grandparents.”

Musk retweeted a video of Emmanuel Macron making a similar gesture, asking when the French president would resign since Musk himself was facing so much backlash. The question is revealing – people are willing to believe Musk is a neo-Nazi. Macron’s movements did not elicit the same reaction. Might that give Musk pause and cause him to re-evaluate his political positions? I doubt it, but we can wonder.

… and then Musk makes a mess

One day after Trump threw his weight behind Stargate, Musk declared the project a financial farce.

“They don’t actually have the money,” he said about the initiative.

Even considering his propensity to post on Twitter/X about an eye-watering swath of topics, Musk’s tweets pronouncing Stargate nothing more than hot air represent an extraordinary break with the White House, where he is one of Trump’s closest and most senior advisers.

Altman tried to strike a conciliatory tone with his first response. Then at least one glove came off when he wrote snidely about Musk’s Softbank remark. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella chimed in with: “All I know is that I’m good for my $80bn.”

Members of Trump’s staff are furious that Musk would trash a public commitment the president called “monumental”, Politico reports. One Trump ally gave a choice quote: “It’s clear he has abused the proximity to the president. The problem is the president doesn’t have any leverage over him and Elon gives zero fucks.”

Exclusive: Don Lemon expands his suit against Musk

View image in fullscreen Don Lemon speaks at the Glaad Media awards in New York, on 11 May 2024; Elon Musk attends an antisemitism symposium in Kraków, Poland, on Wednesday. Composite: Getty Images, NurPhoto

Former CNN anchor Don Lemon is widening his lawsuit against X. He’s added new claims – defamation, retaliation, breach of implied contract and harassment – and two new defendants: CEO Linda Yaccarino and X’s head of content, talent and brand sales, Brett Weitz, whom he alleges were party to his broken contract. The amended suit was filed in late December in San Francisco superior court.

Lemon sued Musk and X in August for fraud, misuse of Lemon’s name and likeness, and breach of contract. X did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

The expanded suit alleges Musk and co retaliated against Lemon for raising concerns that they were “fostering a workplace that promoted racism and sexism” during his interview with Musk, the first in what was supposed to be a series hosted on X. From the Guardian’s story on the lawsuit: “The interview quickly became tense and awkward as Lemon questioned Musk on a variety of issues from his thoughts on white privilege and opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion programs.”

According to the amended filing, after Lemon voiced these reservations, the billionaire subjected him to a “relentless series of insults, name-calling, and vulgarities on the X platform, which targeted his identity as a homosexual man”, including comparing him with the histrionic teenage girl in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Veruca Salt.

Lemon’s contractual allegations concern the fact that there was, in fact, no signed agreement between the anchor and X or Musk.

“Within one day of the interview, Musk sent Lemon’s agent a text message stating that Lemon’s partnership ‘contract [with Defendants] is canceled.’ Close to this time, Weitz spoke with Lemon by phone and told Lemon that Defendants were not going to pay him or follow through with the promises and representations made to him because there was no signed agreement, despite Musk previously representing to Lemon that there would be no need for a formal written agreement or to ‘fill out paperwork.’ To this day, Defendants have not compensated Lemon pursuant to the exclusive partnership deal that Defendants induced Lemon to enter into.”

Lemon alleges that the defendants then defamed him to cover up their own wrongdoing. His additional allegations come at a time when tech companies and the Trump administration, of which Musk is an integral part, are slashing programs meant to decrease discrimination.

Are Crypto.com and Kalshi’s new ‘sports trading products’ legal?

View image in fullscreen Are ‘sports event trading products’ and sports betting the same thing? Illustration: Guardian Design

My colleague Callum Jones writes:

The Super Bowl, the biggest sporting event in the US, typically consists of a spectacular half-time show and semi-amusing commercials, with a few hours of sport sprinkled in between. But this year’s event, in New Orleans next month between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, has been commandeered for an extraordinary experiment.

Prediction betting markets grew rapidly around the US presidential election. Now their owners are trying to push the envelope – testing the legal and political parameters of the “golden age”, hailed by Trump – to find the boundaries of this nascent industry.

Late last month, Crypto.com announced the “first ever sports event trading product”, enabling people across the US to “trade their own prediction” on the result of sports events, including the Super Bowl.

There’s another word for putting money on sports, in the hope of making a profit if your prediction proves right. But sports betting is technically only allowed in some of the US – 38 states, to be exact, and operating a legal platform often requires close cooperation with local authorities. Are “sports event trading products” and sports betting the same thing?

Crypto.com launched its new sports service across all 50 states. In the final days of the Biden administration, the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) launched a review and asked the firm to suspend its sports markets. It did not.

Not only did Crypto.com ignore this request, but Kalshi, another leading player in prediction markets, has since launched its own sports markets. With Trump now in office, these platforms are using sports, and the Super Bowl, to gauge how aggressively his new administration will regulate online prediction markets. The president hailed what he called “gambling polls” (and his healthy lead in them) in the final weeks of the election campaign; one of his sons had since joined Kalshi as a strategic adviser.

“The Golden Age of markets is here,” Kalshi declared on social media last week. The CFTC, under new management, did not respond to a request for comment.","{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.9927}",0.9927
"Inside_China,_DeepSeek_Provides_a_National_Mic_Dro.txt","Inside China, it was called the tipping point for the global technological rivalry with the United States and the “darkest hour” in Silicon Valley, evoking Winston Churchill. It was possibly a breakthrough that could change the country’s destiny.

The news that the Chinese start-up DeepSeek can build artificial intelligence models that are as good as OpenAI’s, and at a fraction of the cost, tanked the stock market on Monday and sent Silicon Valley into a panic.

The claim about DeepSeek’s success was viewed in China as a shot in the arm for a discouraged tech industry and a public that’s suffering through a stagnating economy. On social media posts and state news outlets, DeepSeek was nothing less than a testament to the country’s ability to innovate, especially when facing efforts by the United States to limit China’s access to the most advanced technologies.

“A nation like China, which is equipped with substantial technological resources, cannot truly be suppressed,” wrote Hu Xijin, a retired editor in chief of the Communist Party tabloid Global Times. “U.S. sanctions in one area will only spur more comprehensive and resilient progress in China, potentially leading to breakthroughs that outpace the U.S.”","{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': 0.9669}",0.9669
"DeepSeek_advances_could_heighten_safety_risk,_says.txt","The potential for artificial intelligence systems to be used for malicious acts is increasing, according to a landmark report by AI experts, with the study’s lead author warning that DeepSeek and other disruptors could heighten the safety risk.

Yoshua Bengio, regarded as one of the godfathers of modern AI, said advances by the Chinese startup DeepSeek could be a worrying development in a field that has been dominated by the US in recent years.

“It’s going to mean a closer race, which usually is not a good thing from the point of view of AI safety,” he said.

Bengio said American firms and other rivals to DeepSeek could focus on regaining their lead instead of on safety. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, which DeepSeek has challenged with the launch of its own virtual assistant, pledged this week to accelerate product releases as a result.

“If you imagine a competition between two entities and one thinks they’re way ahead, then they can afford to be more prudent and still know that they will stay ahead,” Bengio said. “Whereas if you have a competition between two entities and they think that the other is just at the same level, then they need to accelerate. Then maybe they don’t give as much attention to safety.”

Bengio was speaking in a personal capacity before the publication of a wide-ranging report on AI safety.

The first full International AI Safety report has been compiled by a group of 96 experts including the Nobel prize winner Geoffrey Hinton. Bengio, a co-winner in 2018 of the Turing award – referred to as the Nobel prize of computing – was commissioned by the UK government to preside over the report, which was announced at the global AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in 2023. Panel members were nominated by 30 countries as well as the EU and UN. The next global AI summit takes place in Paris on 10 and 11 February.

The report states that since publication of an interim study in May last year, general-purpose AI systems such as chatbots have become more capable in “domains that are relevant for malicious use”, such as the use of automated tools to highlight vulnerabilities in software and IT systems, and giving guidance on the production of biological and chemical weapons.

It says new AI models can generate step-by-step technical instructions for creating pathogens and toxins that surpass the capability of experts with PhDs, with OpenAI acknowledging that its advanced o1 model could assist specialists in planning how to produce biological threats.

However, the report says it is uncertain whether novices would be able to act on the guidance, and that models can also be used for beneficial purposes such as in medicine.

Speaking to the Guardian, Bengio said models had already emerged that could, with the use of a smartphone camera, theoretically guide people through dangerous tasks such as trying to build a bioweapon.

“These tools are becoming easier and easier to use by non-experts, because they can decompose a complicated task into smaller steps that everyone can understand, and then they can interactively help you get them right. And that’s very different from using, say, Google search,” he said.

The report says AI systems have improved significantly since last year in their ability to spot flaws in software autonomously, without human intervention. This could help hackers plan cyber-attacks.

However, the report says carrying out real-world attacks autonomously is beyond AI systems so far because they require “an exceptional level of precision”.

Elsewhere in its analysis of the risks posed by AI, the report points to a significant increase in deepfake content, where the technology is used to produce a convincing likeness of a person – whether their image, voice or both. It says deepfakes have been used to trick companies into handing over money, to commit blackmail and to create pornographic images of people. It says gauging the precise level of increase in such behaviour is difficult due to a lack of comprehensive and reliable statistics.

There are also risks of malicious use because so-called closed-source models, where the underlying code cannot be modified, can be vulnerable to jailbreaks that circumvent safety guardrails, while open-source models such as Meta’s Llama, which are free to download and can be tweaked by specialists, pose risks of “facilitating malicious or misguided” use by bad actors.

In a last-minute addition to the report written by Bengio, the Canadian computer scientist notes the emergence in December – shortly after the report had been finalised – of a new advanced “reasoning” model by OpenAI called o3. Bengio said its ability to make a breakthrough on a key abstract reasoning test was an achievement that many experts, including himself, had thought until recently was out of reach.

“The trends evidenced by o3 could have profound implications for AI risks,” writes Bengio, who also flagged DeepSeek’s R1 model. “The risk assessments in this report should be read with the understanding that AI has gained capabilities since the report was written.”

Bengio told the Guardian that advances in reasoning could have consequences for the job market by creating autonomous agents capable of carrying out human tasks, but could also assist terrorists.

“If you’re a terrorist, you’d like to have an AI that’s very autonomous,” he said. “As we increase agency, we increase the potential benefits of AI and we increase the risks.”

However, Bengio said AI systems had yet to pull off the long-term planning that could create fully autonomous tools that evade human control. “If an AI cannot plan over a long horizon, it’s hardly going to be able to escape our control,” he said.

Elsewhere, the near 300-page report cites “well-established” concerns about AI including generating scams and child sexual abuse imagery; biased outputs, and privacy violations such as the leaking of sensitive information shared with a chatbot. It said researchers had not been able to “fully resolve” those fears.

AI can be loosely defined as computer systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

The report, whose full title is the International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI, flags AI’s “rapidly growing” impact on the environment through the use of datacentres, and the potential for AI agents to have a “profound” impact on the job market.

It says the future of AI is uncertain, with a wide range of outcomes possible in the near future including “very positive and very negative outcomes”. It says societies and governments still have a chance to decide which path the technology takes.

“This uncertainty can evoke fatalism and make AI appear as something that happens to us. But it will be the decisions of societies and governments on how to navigate this uncertainty that determine which path we will take,” the report says.","{'neg': 0.063, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.9284}",0.9284

While there are some questions about the quality, on some measures China now exceeds the US on what is known as ""citation-weighted"" patents too, which adjusts for how often new scientific papers are referred to.

In terms of patents generally, more are being filed in China than in the rest of the world put together. In 2023 China filed 1.7 million patents , against 600,000 in the US. Two decades earlier China had a third of the patents filed by the US, a quarter of Japan's and was well behind South Korea and Europe.

There are on average more than 6,000 PhDs in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) coming out of Chinese universities every month. In the US it is more like 2,000-3,000, in the UK it is 1,500.

The raw materials of artificial intelligence (AI) are microchips, science PhDs and data. On the latter two, China might be ahead already.

This is not an accident. This is policy.

The obscure Hangzhou hedge fund that coded a ChatGPT competitor as a side project it claims cost just $5.6m to train emerges from a concerted effort to invest in future generations of technology.

China's success in technology has not come out of thin air, even given the unlikely origins of the DeepSeek deep shock.

Chinese lithium-ion electric batteries now cost per kWh about a seventh of what they cost a decade ago. DeepSeek is doing in AI exactly what China has done elsewhere.

While the impact of this was most visible in electric vehicles (EVs), where China is now the world's biggest exporter, having cornered the supply chains and the science for battery technology, it stretches well beyond.

Even in auto the Chinese manufacturers are now pushing the concept of ""electric intelligent vehicles"", in which conventional carmakers cannot compete, especially on software development.

China's consumer electronics companies are shifting into car manufacturing, with ""dark factories"" operated 24/7 by armies of AI-powered robots, now also increasingly made in China.

The country is electrifying at an astonishing rate, and is referred to by some researchers as an ""electro state"". It now files three-quarters of all clean tech patents, versus a twentieth at the start of the century.

Last year the US National Science Board asserted China's objective of being the world's leading science and engineering nation was on the verge of being achieved. ""We already see this in artificial intelligence, where China out publishes us, has more patents, and produces more students than the United States,"" they wrote.

Delegates who accompanied the UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to China earlier this month marvelled at how the Beijing air had been cleaned up, and indigenous electric cars were everywhere. Another UK CEO told me of a visit to Huawei's Oxbridge-style campus complete with spires and bridges, and its own Tube line, purely for its scientists.

Clearly, however, there are concerns about censorship, democracy and security. One of the drivers of the Chinese AI industry has been access to extraordinary amounts of data, which is more difficult to get hold of in the West.

If the US Congress was sufficiently concerned about TikTok to ban it, then surely a table-topping AI program could be highly problematic. President Trump's argument this morning was that DeepSeek's innovation was ""positive"" and ""a wake-up call"". China has not been prominent as the first target of Trump tariffs.

There is still an obvious balancing act for the UK government here. But this sort of innovation and its impact on the world was exactly why the chancellor visited Beijing a fortnight ago.

She said at the time she wanted a long-term relationship with China that is ""squarely in our national interest"" with the visit part of a ""commitment to explore deeper economic co-operation"" between Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and President Xi.

Other European nations such as Spain have encouraged China not just to set up factories but to transfer its advanced battery technology, for example, into Europe.

The West wants China to make its T-shirts, its tables, its TVs and EVs. But could that really now stretch into DeepSeek data-hungry AI models too? It is a deep tremor, not just for tech, but for economics and geopolitics as well.","{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.918, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': 0.9815}",0.9815
"What’s_DeepSeek,_China’s_AI_startup_sending_shockw.txt","Chip giant Nvidia shed nearly $600bn in market value after Chinese AI model cast doubt on supremacy of US tech firms.

DeepSeek, a little-known Chinese startup, has sent shockwaves through the global tech sector with the release of an artificial intelligence (AI) model whose capabilities rival the creations of Google and OpenAI.

DeepSeek-R1’s creator says its model was developed using less advanced, and fewer, computer chips than employed by tech giants in the United States.

In a research paper released last week, the model’s development team said they had spent less than $6m on computing power to train the model – a fraction of the multibillion-dollar AI budgets enjoyed by US tech giants such as OpenAI and Google, the creators of ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively.

Marc Andreessen, one of the most influential tech venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, hailed the release of the model as “AI’s Sputnik moment”.

The sudden emergence of a small Chinese startup capable of rivalling Silicon Valley’s top players has challenged assumptions about US dominance in AI and raised fears that the sky-high market valuations of companies such as Nvidia and Meta may be detached from reality.

On Monday, Nvidia, which holds a near-monopoly on producing the semiconductors that power generative AI, lost nearly $600bn in market capitalisation after its shares plummeted 17 percent.

US President Donald Trump, who last week announced the launch of a $500bn AI initiative led by OpenAI, Texas-based Oracle and Japan’s SoftBank, said DeepSeek should serve as a “wake-up call” on the need for US industry to be “laser-focused on competing to win”.

What is DeepSeek?

DeepSeek, which is based in Hangzhou, was founded in late 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a serial entrepreneur who also runs the hedge fund High-Flyer.

Though little known outside China, Liang has an extensive history of combining burgeoning technologies and investing.

In 2013, he co-founded Hangzhou Jacobi Investment Management, an investment firm that employed AI to implement trading strategies, along with a co-alumnus of Zhejiang University, according to Chinese media outlet Sina Finance.

Liang went on to establish two more firms focused on computer-directed investment – Hangzhou Huanfang Technology Co and Ningbo Huanfang Quantitative Investment Management Partnership – in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

In an interview with Chinese media outlet Waves in 2023, Liang dismissed the suggestion that it was too late for startups to get involved in AI or that it should be considered prohibitively costly.

“Reproduction alone is relatively cheap — based on public papers and open-source code, minimal times of training, or even fine-tuning, suffices. Research, however, involves extensive experiments, comparisons, and higher computational and talent demands,” Liang said, according to a translation of his comments published by the ChinaTalk Substack.

Liang said his interest in AI was driven primarily by “curiosity”.

“From a broader perspective, we want to validate certain hypotheses. For example, we hypothesise that the essence of human intelligence might be language, and human thought could essentially be a linguistic process,” he said, according to the transcript.

“What you think of as ‘thinking’ might actually be your brain weaving language. This suggests that human-like AGI could potentially emerge from large language models,” he added, referring to artificial general intelligence (AGI), a type of AI that attempts to imitate the cognitive abilities of the human mind.

DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Monday, Gregory Zuckerman, a journalist with The Wall Street Journal, said he had learned that Liang, who he had not heard of previously, wrote the preface for the Chinese edition of a book he authored about the late American hedge fund manager Jim Simons.

“Simons left a deep impact, apparently,” Zuckerman wrote in a column, describing how Liang praised his book as a tome that “unravels many previously unresolved mysteries and brings us a wealth of experiences to learn from”.

“Even my mother didn’t get that much out of the book,” Zuckerman wrote.

Why has DeepSeek taken the tech world by storm?

Put simply, the company’s success has raised existential questions about the approach to AI being taken by both Silicon Valley and the US government.

US tech firms have been widely assumed to have a critical edge in AI, not least because of their enormous size, which allows them to draw top talent from around the world and invest massive sums in building data centres and purchasing large quantities of costly high-end chips.

DeepSeek’s arrival on the scene has challenged the assumption that it takes billions of dollars to be at the forefront of AI.

“OpenAI was founded 10 years ago, has 4,500 employees, and has raised $6.6 billion in capital. DeepSeek was founded less than 2 years ago, has 200 employees, and was developed for less than $10 million,” Adam Kobeissi, the founder of market analysis newsletter The Kobeissi Letter, said on X on Monday.

“How are these two companies now competitors?”

In their research paper, DeepSeek’s engineers said they had used about 2,000 Nvidia H800 chips, which are less advanced than the most cutting-edge chips, to train its model.

The team said it utilised multiple specialised models working together to enable slower chips to analyse data more efficiently.

For the US government, DeepSeek’s arrival on the scene raises questions about its strategy of trying to contain China’s AI advances by restricting exports of high-end chips.

DeepSeek’s research paper suggests that either the most advanced chips are not needed to create high-performing AI models or that Chinese firms can still source chips in sufficient quantities – or a combination of both.

California-based Nvidia’s H800 chips, which were designed to comply with US export controls, were freely exported to China until October 2023, when the administration of then-President Joe Biden added them to its list of restricted items.

In his 2023 interview with Waves, Liang said his company had stockpiled 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs before they were banned for export. GPUs, or graphics processing units, are electronic circuits used to speed up graphics and image processing on computing devices.

Tanishq Abraham, former research director at Stability AI, said he was not surprised by China’s level of progress in AI given the rollout of various models by Chinese firms such as Alibaba and Baichuan.

“While there have been restrictions on China’s ability to obtain GPUs, China still has managed to innovate and squeeze performance out of whatever they have,” Abraham told Al Jazeera.

“I think it is a lesson to US companies that there is still a lot of performance they can squeeze out of.”

Tara Javidi, co-director of the Center for Machine Intelligence, Computing and Security at the University of California San Diego, said DeepSeek made her excited about the “rapid progress” taking place in AI development worldwide.

“My only hope is that the attention given to this announcement will foster greater intellectual interest in the topic, further expand the talent pool, and, last but not least, increase both private and public investment in AI research in the US,” Javidi told Al Jazeera.

Meanwhile, investors’ confidence in the US tech scene has taken a hit – at least in the short term.

Apart from Nvidia’s dramatic slide, Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft on Monday saw their stock prices fall 4.03 percent and 2.14 percent, respectively, though Apple and Amazon finished higher.

“If DeepSeek’s cost numbers are real, then now pretty much any large organisation in any company can build on and host it,” Tim Miller, a professor specialising in AI at the University of Queensland, told Al Jazeera.

“So, in this sense, the game has changed completely because there is a new ‘rule’ that anyone can play.”

Does this mean China is winning the AI race?

Not necessarily.

While tech analysts broadly agree that DeepSeek-R1 performs at a similar level to ChatGPT – or even better for certain tasks – the field is moving fast.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this month that the company would release its latest reasoning AI model, o3 mini, within weeks after considering user feedback.

On Monday, Altman acknowledged that DeepSeek-R1 was “impressive” while defending his company’s focus on greater computing power.

“We will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! We will pull up some releases,” Altman said on X.

“But mostly we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission.”

Rui Ma, the founder of Tech Buzz China, said the Chinese tech sector had itself been taken aback when OpenAI initially released ChatGPT in 2022.

“Most entrepreneurs had completely missed the opportunity that generative AI represented, and felt very humbled,” Ma told Al Jazeera.

“It’s clear that they have been hard at work since. I think what this past weekend shows us is how seriously they self-reflected and took the challenge to ‘catch up’ to Silicon Valley. I think that for the US to retain its lead, Washington should focus on boosting Silicon Valley instead of on suppressing China.”

Abraham, the former research director at Stability AI, said perceptions may also be skewed by the fact that, unlike DeepSeek, companies such as OpenAI have not made their most advanced models freely available to the public.

“DeepSeek made its best model available for free to use. On the other hand, OpenAI’s best model is not free,” he said.

“So most people who use ChatGPT for free are shocked by DeepSeek and believe there is a huge jump in capabilities when OpenAI has had a similar performing model paywalled for a few months already. This pay-walling of frontier AI models leads to people not truly grasping the progress and capabilities of AI.”

Miller, the University of Queensland professor, said DeepSeek’s advances and other recent developments suggest that China is at least “up there” with the US in AI.

“I made somewhat of a throwaway prediction late last year that the next scientific breakthrough in AI could come from a small player such as an individual university researcher who doesn’t have access to much computing power – they would need to be smarter to compete,” he said.

“DeepSeek’s apparent progress is almost an example of this: by not having enough computational power to build models as large as ChatGPT, they had to be smart. Necessity is the mother of invention.”","{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': 0.9993}",0.9993
DeepSeek_blocked_from_some_app_stores_in_Italy_ami.txt,"The Chinese AI platform DeepSeek has become unavailable for download from some app stores in Italy as regulators in Rome and in Ireland demanded answers from the company about its handling of citizens’ data.

Amid growing concern on Wednesday about how data harvested by the new chatbot could be used by the Chinese government, the app disappeared from the Apple and Google app stores in Italy with customers seeing messages that said it was “currently not available in the country or area you are in” for Apple and the download “was not supported” for Google, Reuters reported.

The Guardian confirmed it was not available in the Google app store, but it was available in the Apple store for at least one user. Both Google and Apple have been approached for comment.

After the Chinese chatbot was released last week close to $1tn (£804m) was wiped off the leading US tech stock index. The UK government said on Tuesday it was up to citizens if they wanted to use the app, with officials in London monitoring any national security threat to data from the new AI platform and saying they would not hesitate to take action if threats emerged.

The Italian regulator for the protection of personal data, known as the Garante, said it wanted to know what personal data is collected, from which sources, for what purposes, on what legal basis and whether it is stored in China. It gave DeepSeek and its affiliated companies 20 days to respond to its questions.

“Our office will launch an in-depth investigation to see if GDPR rules [European Union data protection regulations] are being respected,” said the head of the Italian data regulator, Pasquale Stanzione, according to the Italian ANSA news agency.

A spokesperson for the Irish Data Protection Commission in Dublin, meanwhile, told the Guardian it had also “written to DeepSeek requesting information on the data processing conducted in relation to data subjects in Ireland”.

DeepSeek became the most downloaded free app in the Apple app store in the US and the UK after it emerged it could achieve comparable performance to competitors such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.

The Chinese app’s privacy policy states personal information it collects from users is held “on secure servers located in the People’s Republic of China”. It says it uses data to “comply with our legal obligations, or as necessary to perform tasks in the public interest, or to protect the vital interests of our users and other people”.

China’s national intelligence law states that all enterprises, organisations and citizens “shall support, assist and cooperate with national intelligence efforts”.

In a further development, Open AI said it was “reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models”. Distilling is the process of condensing one large AI model into a smaller faster one.

Open AI said: “We know that groups in the PRC are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to try to replicate advanced US AI models. We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the US government to protect the most capable models being built here.”","{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.125, 'compound': 0.9972}",0.9972
Nvidia_says_AI_chip_sales_strong_despite_DeepSeek_.txt,"Nvidia says AI chip sales strong despite DeepSeek fears

But DeepSeek said it had trained its chatbot using less advanced, and less expensive chips.

Nvidia has seen a surge of demand, as big tech companies turn to the firm for chips that can handle the large amounts of data used to train AI models.

Sales of the firm's chips hit more than $39bn (£30.7bn) over the three months ended 27 January, up 74% year-on-year.

Nvidia, the chip giant at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, said its business remained strong, despite fears of a bubble stirred by the emergence of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek last month.

Its launch prompted a sharp sell-off in Nvidia shares earlier this month, a hit felt throughout the market.

Investors calmed after big companies such as Facebook owner Meta said they expected to continue their current AI investment strategies.

Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said he was not worried that demand would suddenly shift, saying that software in the future would be created by machine learning that needs chips with different architecture than the ""hand-coding"" of the past.

""We know fundamentally software has changed,"" he said, adding that it was also still ""early days"" for the use of AI to spread.

Nvidia currently dominates the market in advanced chips, making it central to the boom in AI investment at companies such as Microsoft.

Its shares have surged more than 400% over the last two years, giving the company a market value of more than $3tn.

Nvidia said it was focused on rapidly building out production of its latest chips, known as Blackwell, which helped to drive a surge in the firm's revenue.

The company's finance chief Collette Kress said its AI data centre business was strongest in the US, but the firm was also seeing demand grow in other parts of the world, pointing to investments by France and the European Union.

She said demand in China - where US trade controls have blocked the firm from exporting certain chips - remained lower and that the firm expected shipments to remain roughly at the current level.","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.9931}",0.9931
DeepSeek_spreads_across_China_with_Beijing’s_backi.txt,"DeepSeek’s advances have sparked a nationwide push in China to deploy its large language models everywhere from hospitals to local governments as Beijing seeks to consolidate its gains in generative artificial intelligence.

Since the Hangzhou-based start-up shook global markets with its R1 model in late January there has been lightning adoption of its technology in its home country, with companies and state bodies throwing their weight behind the new national AI champion.

All the major cloud service providers, at least six car manufacturers, several local governments, a number of hospitals and a handful of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have moved to deploy DeepSeek, with the shift among traditionally conservative institutions particularly striking.

“Even though the [Chinese Communist] party has long been supportive of AI, DeepSeek has provided the impetus for government departments and SOEs to roll out LLMs,” said an SOE tech supplier who did not wish to be named. “DeepSeek changed everything. It started a nationwide effort to push forward Chinese AI,” they added.

The low cost of deploying DeepSeek’s models has contributed to the rapid adoption. Adina Yakefu, China AI expert at machine learning platform Hugging Face, said DeepSeek was “profoundly reshaping the landscape of the industry” after it “lowered the barriers to model development and application through its open-source strategy, knowledge distillation techniques and cost-effective training solutions”.

Jilin University Hospital in the eastern city of Changchun has rolled out a diagnostic tool it claims can produce treatment plans through DeepSeek consulting the hospital’s database, medical guidelines and drug efficacy results. Jinxin Women and Children’s Hospital in south-western China said it had a tool for patients to track their ovulation cycles, with test results combined with the hospital’s patient data to produce personalised fertility plans.

One doctor at a public hospital in Hubei province in central China said the institution’s leadership had issued a directive that DeepSeek should be used as a third-party arbiter if two doctors have differing views on a patient’s treatment.

There have been rollouts in public hospitals in Chengdu, Hangzhou and Wuhan for less complex applications, such as digital nurses directing patients to the right consulting room or explaining complicated medical reports.

Several industry insiders cautioned against taking all the announcements at face value, as some companies were trying to capture investor enthusiasm around DeepSeek without meaningfully deploying its models. Meanwhile, government bodies are also under political pressure to be seen as aligned with China’s AI darling.

The SOE tech supplier said “much work still needs to be done to make these models useful” for more complex work such as medical diagnosis. “It must be trained on enough medical data to produce good results. This will take time and needs collaboration from leading AI companies. It is not something hospitals can build on their own,” they said.

Another doctor described a move to deploy DeepSeek last week at a hospital in eastern Zhejiang as a “publicity stunt”.

Even if some announcements should be treated with scepticism, experts say the willingness to test out its models still marks a step change.

“The pace at which DeepSeek is spreading is incredible. Before, conservative institutions like government agencies and hospitals were nervous about introducing generative AI applications, fearing trouble if something goes wrong,” said one Hangzhou-based AI engineer.

Local governments, including Jinan’s and Hangzhou’s, have launched citizen chatbots built on DeepSeek so that residents can ask questions about everything from tax payments and rubbish collection to birth certificates. The city of Shenzhen’s Futian district has launched multiple AI agents built on DeepSeek models, including a document generation tool for law enforcement officers to draft administrative reports.

Beijing’s public embrace of DeepSeek is fuelling the rapid adoption, with the start-up’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, invited to a meeting with President Xi Jinping this month, alongside business heavyweights such as BYD chair Wang Chuanfu, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei and Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Tencent announced it deployed DeepSeek in the search function of its ubiquitous app, WeChat. BYD and Great Wall Motor are among the automakers that have rolled out DeepSeek. Meanwhile, many SOEs, including Sinopec, PetroChina and the China Southern Power Grid, have all said they are deploying its technology.

DeepSeek is not capitalising financially on its widespread usage, according to people familiar with its business model. It allows its models to be downloaded for free and they can be run on public cloud or private servers, making providers such as AliCloud and Huawei Cloud the prime beneficiaries of the recent surge in uptake.

HSBC tech hardware analyst Frank He wrote in an analyst note that DeepSeek “AI inferencing workloads have been surging, triggered by the growing popularity of DeepSeek R1 in recent weeks”. He predicted demand would continue and “trigger related hardware and software upgrades in cloud computing and AI infrastructure”.

The_DeepSeek_panic_reveals_an_AI_world_ready_to_bl.txt,"The arrival of DeepSeek R1, an AI language model built by the Chinese AI lab DeepSeek, has been nothing less than seismic. The system only launched last week, but already the app has shot to the top of download charts, sparked a $1tn (£800bn) sell-off of tech stocks, and elicited apocalyptic commentary in Silicon Valley. The simplest take on R1 is correct: it’s an AI system equal in capability to state-of-the-art US models that was built on a shoestring budget, thus demonstrating Chinese technological prowess. But the big lesson is perhaps not what DeepSeek R1 reveals about China, but about western neuroses surrounding AI.

For AI obsessives, the arrival of R1 was not a total shock. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 as a subsidiary of the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, which focuses on data-heavy financial analysis – a field that demands similar skills to top-end AI research. Its subsidiary lab quickly started producing innovative papers, and CEO Liang Wenfeng told interviewers last November that the work was motivated not by profit but “passion and curiosity”.

This approach has paid off, and last December the company launched DeepSeek-V3, a predecessor of R1 with the same appealing qualities of high performance and low cost. Like ChatGPT, V3 and R1 are large language models (LLMs): chatbots that can be put to a huge variety of uses, from copywriting to coding. Leading AI researcher Andrej Karpathy spotted the company’s potential last year, commenting on the launch of V3: “DeepSeek (Chinese AI co) making it look easy today with an open weights release of a frontier-grade LLM trained on a joke of a budget.” (That quoted budget was $6m – hardly pocket change, but orders of magnitude less than the $100m-plus needed to train OpenAI’s GPT-4 in 2023.)

R1’s impact has been far greater for a few different reasons.

First, it’s what’s known as a “chain of thought” model, which means that when you give it a query, it talks itself through the answer: a simple trick that hugely improves response quality. This has not only made R1 directly comparable to OpenAI’s o1 model (another chain of thought system whose performance R1 rivals) but boosted its ability to answer maths and coding queries – problems that AI experts value highly. Also, R1 is much more accessible. Not only is it free to use via the app (as opposed to the $20 a month you have to pay OpenAI to talk to o1) but it’s totally free for developers to download and implement into their businesses. All of this has meant that R1’s performance has been easier to appreciate, just as ChatGPT’s chat interface made existing AI smarts accessible for the first time in 2022.

Second, the method of R1’s creation undermines Silicon Valley’s current approach to AI. The dominant paradigm in the US is to scale up existing models by simply adding more data and more computing power to achieve greater performance. It’s this approach that has led to huge increases in energy demands for the sector and tied tech companies to politicians. The bill for developing AI is so huge that techies now want to leverage state financing and infrastructure, while politicians want to buy their loyalty and be seen supporting growing companies. (See, for example, Trump’s $500bn “Stargate” announcement earlier this month.) R1 overturns the accepted wisdom that scaling is the way forward. The system is thought to be 95% cheaper than OpenAI’s o1 and uses one tenth of the computing power of another comparable LLM, Meta’s Llama 3.1 model. To achieve equivalent performance at a fraction of the budget is what’s truly shocking about R1, and it’s this that has made its launch so impactful. It suggests that US companies are throwing money away and can be beaten by more nimble competitors.

But after these baseline observations, it gets tricky to say exactly what R1 “means” for AI. Some are arguing that R1’s launch shows we’re overvaluing companies like Nvidia, which makes the chips integral to the scaling paradigm. But it’s also possible the opposite is true: that R1 shows AI services will fall in price and demand will, therefore, increase (an economic effect known as Jevons paradox, which Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella helpfully shared a link to on Monday). Similarly, you might argue that R1’s launch shows the failure of US policy to limit Chinese tech development via export controls on chips. But, as AI policy researcher Lennart Heim has argued, export controls take time to work and affect not just AI training but deployment across the economy. So, even if export controls don’t stop the launches of flagships systems like R1, they might still help the US retain its technological lead (if that’s the outcome you want).

All of this is to say that the exact effects of R1’s launch are impossible to predict. There are too many complicating factors and too many unknowns to say what the future holds. However, that hasn’t stopped the tech world and markets reacting in a frenzy, with CEOs panicking, stock prices cratering, and analysts scrambling to revise predictions for the sector. And what this really shows is that the world of AI is febrile, unpredictable and overly reactive. This a dangerous combination, and if R1 doesn’t cause a destructive meltdown of this system, it’s likely that some future launch will.","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.801, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.9956}",0.9956
Tech_billionaires_lost_almost_$100bn_in_stock_mark.txt,"DeepSeek’s cut-price challenge to US AI dominance, which wiped $600bn in Nvidia’s market value on Monday and caused the tech-weighted Nasdaq index to drop 3%, also took a bite out of the fortunes of some of the world’s wealthiest men.

Nvidia’s record stock plunge, judged to be the biggest market value drop in US stock market history, according to Bloomberg, took with it $20.7bn of its CEO and biggest individual shareholder, Jensen Huang.

The share-price drop left Huang, the company co-founder, with a net worth of $103.7bn late on Monday, down from $124.4bn. According to Forbes’ real-time billionaires ranking, that pushes the 61-year-old tech tycoon from 10th to 17th place in global wealth rankings, behind Zara fashion mogul Amancio Ortega; Walmart heirs Rob, Jim and Alice Walton; Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates; Dell CEO Michael Dell; and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Exceeding Huang’s paper losses from Monday’s trading is cat rancher and Oracle chair Larry Ellison, who recorded a $27.6bn loss after shares in Oracle stock dropped 14%, knocking him down from third wealthiest man to fifth, behind Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and LVMH luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault.

Others hit by the Nvidia selloff and related tech share drops were Dell ($12.4bn); Google cofounders Larry Page ($6.3bn) and Sergey Brin ($5.9bn); Google investor Andreas von Bechtolsheim ($5.4bn); Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3bn); and Interactive Brokers chair Thomas Peterffy ($4.1bn).

In all, tech sector titans as a group saw $94bn of wealth evaporate – roughly 85% of the $108bn of DeepSeek and Nvidia-related losses among the world’s 500 wealthiest people, according to Bloomberg.

Monday’s tech selloff comes ahead of this week’s fourth-quarter earnings reports from Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple, whose executives are likely to be questioned closely on their multibillion AI spending plans. The losses across the “magnificent seven” – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – account for around $1tn of their total market value of $17tn.

Some analysts believe the selloff amounted to little more than an overreaction. “I believe the demand for the best AI hardware will persist,” tech analyst Gene Munster said on X. “Hyperscalers, enterprises, and sovereign entities are not looking for a cheaper way to achieve AGI [artificial general intelligence]. They’re looking for a faster way to get there. DeepSeek doesn’t alter that dynamic.”

Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote to note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown”.

And reports that DeepSeek spent just $5.6m in computing power to develop its R1 model aren’t necessarily correct. Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, told CNBC’s Squawk Box on Monday that Chinese labs have more of Nvidia’s $30,000 H100 chips than people think, and perhaps as much as $1bn worth of the company’s equipment.

“My understanding is that DeepSeek has around 50,000 H-100s, which they can’t talk about obviously because it’s against export controls that the United States has put in place,” Wang said. “They have more chips than other people expect but also on a go-forward basis, they’re going to be limited by chip controls and export controls.”","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': 0.9404}",0.9404
China’s_DeepSeek_Surprise.txt,"One week ago, a new and formidable challenger for OpenAI’s throne emerged. A Chinese AI start-up, DeepSeek, launched a model that appeared to match the most powerful version of ChatGPT but, at least according to its creator, was a fraction of the cost to build. The program, called DeepSeek-R1, has incited plenty of concern: Ultrapowerful Chinese AI models are exactly what many leaders of American AI companies feared when they, and more recently President Donald Trump, have sounded alarms about a technological race between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. This is a “wake up call for America,” Alexandr Wang, the CEO of Scale AI, commented on social media.

But at the same time, many Americans—including much of the tech industry—appear to be lauding this Chinese AI. As of this morning, DeepSeek had overtaken ChatGPT as the top free application on Apple’s mobile-app store in the United States. Researchers, executives, and investors have been heaping on praise. The new DeepSeek model “is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, an outspoken supporter of Trump, wrote on X. The program shows “the power of open research,” Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, wrote online.

Indeed, the most notable feature of DeepSeek may be not that it is Chinese, but that it is relatively open. Unlike top American AI labs—OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind—which keep their research almost entirely under wraps, DeepSeek has made the program’s final code, as well as an in-depth technical explanation of the program, free to view, download, and modify. In other words, anybody from any country, including the U.S., can use, adapt, and even improve upon the program. That openness makes DeepSeek a boon for American start-ups and researchers—and an even bigger threat to the top U.S. companies, as well as the government’s national-security interests.

To understand what’s so impressive about DeepSeek, one has to look back to last month, when OpenAI launched its own technical breakthrough: the full release of o1, a new kind of AI model that, unlike all the “GPT”-style programs before it, appears able to “reason” through challenging problems. o1 displayed leaps in performance on some of the most challenging math, coding, and other tests available, and sent the rest of the AI industry scrambling to replicate the new reasoning model—which OpenAI disclosed very few technical details about. The start-up, and thus the American AI industry, were on top. (The Atlantic recently entered into a corporate partnership with OpenAI.)

DeepSeek, less than two months later, not only exhibits those same “reasoning” capabilities apparently at much lower costs but has also spilled to the rest of the world at least one way to match OpenAI’s more covert methods. The program is not entirely open-source—its training data, for instance, and the fine details of its creation are not public—but unlike with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, researchers and start-ups can still study the DeepSearch research paper and directly work with its code. OpenAI has enormous amounts of capital, computer chips, and other resources, and has been working on AI for a decade. In comparison, DeepSeek is a smaller team formed two years ago with far less access to essential AI hardware, because of U.S. export controls on advanced AI chips, but it has relied on various software and efficiency improvements to catch up. DeepSeek has reported that the final training run of a previous iteration of the model that R1 is built from, released last month, cost less than $6 million. Meanwhile, Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, has said that U.S. companies are already spending on the order of $1 billion to train future models. Exactly how much the latest DeepSeek cost to build is uncertain—some researchers and executives, including Wang, have cast doubt on just how cheap it could have been—but the price for software developers to incorporate DeepSeek-R1 into their own products is roughly 95 percent cheaper than incorporating OpenAI’s o1, as measured by the price of every “token”—basically, every word—the model generates.

DeepSeek’s success has abruptly forced a wedge between Americans most directly invested in outcompeting China and those who benefit from any access to the best, most reliable AI models. (It’s a divide that echoes Americans’ attitudes about TikTok—China hawks versus content creators—and other Chinese apps and platforms.) For the start-up and research community, DeepSeek is an enormous win. “A non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive,” Jim Fan, a top AI researcher at the chipmaker Nvidia and a former OpenAI employee, wrote on X. “Truly open, frontier research that empowers all.”

But for America’s top AI companies and the nation’s government, what DeepSeek represents is unclear. The stocks of many major tech firms—including Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft—dropped this morning amid the excitement around the Chinese model. And Meta, which has branded itself as a champion of open-source models in contrast to OpenAI, now seems a step behind. (The company is reportedly panicking.) To some investors, all of those massive data centers, billions of dollars of investment, or even the half-a-trillion-dollar AI-infrastructure joint venture from OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, which Trump recently announced from the White House, could seem far less essential. Maybe bigger AI isn’t better. For those who fear that AI will strengthen “the Chinese Communist Party’s global influence,” as OpenAI wrote in a recent lobbying document, this is legitimately concerning: The DeepSeek app refuses to answer questions about, for instance, the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre of 1989 (although the censorship may be relatively easy to circumvent).

None of that is to say the AI boom is over, or will take a radically different form going forward. The next iteration of OpenAI’s reasoning models, o3, appears far more powerful than o1 and will soon be available to the public. There are some signs that DeepSeek trained on ChatGPT outputs (outputting “I’m ChatGPT” when asked what model it is), although perhaps not intentionally—if that’s the case, it’s possible that DeepSeek could only get a head start thanks to other high-quality chatbots. America’s AI innovation is accelerating, and its major forms are beginning to take on a technical research focus other than reasoning: “agents,” or AI systems that can use computers on behalf of humans. American tech giants could, in the end, even benefit. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, framed DeepSeek as a win: More efficient AI means that use of AI across the board will “skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can’t get enough of,” he wrote on X today—which, if true, would help Microsoft’s profits as well.

Still, the pressure is on OpenAI, Google, and their competitors to maintain their edge. With the release of DeepSeek, the nature of any U.S.-China AI “arms race” has shifted. Preventing AI computer chips and code from spreading to China evidently has not tamped the ability of researchers and companies located there to innovate. And the relatively transparent, publicly available version of DeepSeek could mean that Chinese programs and approaches, rather than leading American programs, become global technological standards for AI—akin to how the open-source Linux operating system is now standard for major web servers and supercomputers. Being democratic—in the sense of vesting power in software developers and users—is precisely what has made DeepSeek a success. If Chinese AI maintains its transparency and accessibility, despite emerging from an authoritarian regime whose citizens can’t even freely use the web, it is moving in exactly the opposite direction of where America’s tech industry is heading.","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.9993}",0.9993
DeepSeek_chaos_suggests_‘America_First’_may_not_al.txt,"CNN —

The stunning rise of DeepSeek is sending shockwaves through the artificial intelligence world, threatening America’s dominance that seemed set in stone just a week ago.

The fact that a little-known Chinese startup has built a model that can compete with leading US AI systems is challenging the conventional wisdom that it takes gobs of money and unlimited access to cutting-edge computer chips to train AI technology. It shouldn’t really be possible for a Chinese AI startup to go toe-to-toe with OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini.

Now, President Donald Trump has to decide how to respond.

The United States has imposed tough restrictions that are designed to prevent Chinese firms from buying or building their own cutting-edge computer chips required to train AI models. These chips are at the heart of the AI arms race and the goal of the export curbs is to prevent China from keeping up.

Some have argued that DeepSeek’s success – it claims to have trained its new AI model R1 at a fraction of the cost and on far fewer high-end chips than leading AI models – shows the Biden and first Trump administrations’ export curbs have backfired: These tough restrictions may have backed Beijing into a corner, forcing Chinese firms to come up with ways to innovate around the export curbs or build their own chips.

“Rather than impeding China, these AI export controls may be accelerating China’s AI capacity by pushing them to innovate,” John Villasenor, a professor of engineering and law at UCLA, told CNN in a phone interview. “The export controls, arguably, are counterproductive.”

That would be a blow to the tough crackdowns under both Trump and former President Joe Biden – and the ones envisioned during this new Trump administration.

“We accidentally upped their technical game,” AI researcher Gary Marcus wrote in a Substack post. “It is clear that the game has changed.”

That notion – that punishing restrictions may have had the opposite effect as the United States intended – is raising tough questions about the very foundation of the AI boom, the tech arms race between the United States and China and how the Trump administration should respond.

The AI house of cards theory

Trump may be unswayed.

“I think Trump doubles down,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, noting that Trump has surrounded himself with China hawks, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “His advisers around him point to more restrictions, not less.”

If Trump adds even more pressure on China over AI, proponents of a more hawkish strategy believe China’s house of AI cards may crumble. Skeptics say it’s not clear how much of a gamechanger DeepSeek is. They argue its success could have been made possible either stockpiling high-end chips before restrictions were imposed or by buying the semiconductors on the black market.

“It is either a Sputnik Moment or a Potemkin Moment,” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN in an email. “It is either truly disruptive or deceptive, relying on hoarded Nvidia chips and others before the export sanction.”

Sonnenfeld added that if it is a “Sputnik-style disruption, it is a blow to pure reliance on competitive private markets without government partnership and national industrial policies.”

Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang told CNBC that he understands DeepSeek has 50,000 leading-edge chips that they “can’t talk about, obviously, because it is against the export controls that the United States has put in place.”

Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, urged investors to take DeepSeek’s claims “with a grain of salt” because there is no concrete proof to back them up.

“China is claiming it has come up with the silver bullet, but it could be like the guy in high school who says he has a girlfriend, but she’s just at a different school,” Hogan said in a phone interview, noting that there has long been skepticism among Western economists about the veracity of China’s economic statistics.

If DeepSeek did have access to leading edge chips, that supports the argument that the export controls should be toughened. Mills notes that there is a “very active” black market for high-end chips and enforcement of export controls has been uneven.

“This has been a game of whack-a-mole,” Mills said. “There are still glaring loopholes that need to be closed.”

For example, Mills pointed to the need for more robust enforcement and further restrictions on the flow of leading-edge computer chips.

Jake Sullivan, the US National Security Adviser under Biden, has acknowledged that the export controls are a work in progress.

“This is an iterative process. We learn, they learn. We learn, they learn,” Sullivan said in May during a fireside chat.

Sullivan also noted that China has tried to overwhelm export controls by projecting an air of inevitability to its AI ambitions.

“The PRC has embarked on a massive and relentless information campaign to basically say, ‘This is futile. Resistance is futile.

We will break these controls,’” Sullivan said.

The stakes are massive.

Many in Washington were well aware that the United States is in an AI arms race. But that race may be a bit closer, and perhaps significantly cheaper, than previously known.","{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.889, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': 0.9505}",0.9505

There are still many undisclosed facts about DeepSeek, regarding its team, funding and chip resources, but “the biggest dark horse” in the AI community has released enough technical information to prove that it spent far less money in developing large language models (LLMs), including its open-source DeepSeek V3, compared to those from bigger tech firms such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms and ChatGPT creator OpenAI . But its models can deliver similar performance.

The breakthrough by DeepSeek has stirred heated debate. For those who believe in DeepSeek, the firm’s success has significant implications for China’s rivalry with the US in AI, and even the future of AI. When Sam Altman’s team unveiled ChatGPT in November 2022, China was caught by surprise. Chinese tech companies scrambled to launch their own LLMs in a chaotic situation known as the “battle of over 100 models”, but the exuberance has been dampened by two dark clouds.

The first potential repercussion is US export restrictions on advanced graphic processing units (GPUs), particularly Nvidia’s much-sought after chips – a restriction that is depriving China of the most powerful weapons in the AI arena.

The second implication is the limited financial resources of Chinese Big Tech firms, compared to their US peers. Under the scaling law, which literally means “the more investment in advanced chips, the better the performance of models”, Chinese AI companies were put in a disadvantageous position.

DeepSeek’s app is an AI assistant similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot. The news of the app’s ascendency in the US – and ability to edge out American rivals for a fraction of the cost – sent technology stocks tumbling on Monday. Nvidia, the AI chip maker and most valuable US company, saw its stocks plummet by 13.6% in early trading, wiping out some $500bn in market capitalization.

Some tech investors were impressed at how quickly DeepSeek was able to create an AI assistant that nearly equals Google’s and OpenAI’s for roughly $5m while other AI companies spend billions for the same results, particularly with China under strict chip export controls that limit DeepSeek’s access to computational power. The model’s low-budget success could threaten the US’s lead in the AI market.

“Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment,” the investor Marc Andreessen wrote on X. Carrying on the “Sputnik” theme, Vivek Ramaswamy posted: “Sputnik-like moments are a good thing. We don’t need to freak out, we just need to wake up.” Ramaswamy is an entrepreneur and politician who is close to Donald Trump.

Trump himself announced a new $500bn AI venture called Stargate last week. It is a collaboration with OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, and the president guaranteed it would be “the future of technology” in the US. The announcement was derided by the Trump ally and AI pioneer Elon Musk, who got into a tiff on X with OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, over how much money Stargate actually has to invest.

Trump, who was attending a House Republicans conference in Florida, said the emergence of DeepSeek should be a “wake-up call” for US companies. He said American companies “need to be laser-focused on competing to win”.

Trump said his decision to revoke the Biden AI rules through executive order would allow AI companies to “focus on being the best” instead of on being the most “woke”.

Experts_urge_caution_over_use_of_Chinese_AI_DeepSe.txt,"Experts have urged caution over rapidly embracing the Chinese artificial intelligence platform DeepSeek, citing concerns about it spreading misinformation and how the Chinese state might exploit users’ data.

The government said its use was a personal choice for citizens, but officials were monitoring any national security threat to data from the new AI and said they would not hesitate to take action if threats emerged.The new low-cost AI wiped $1tn off the leading US tech stock index this week and it rapidly became the most downloaded free app in the UK and the US. Donald Trump called it a “wake-up call” for tech firms.

Its emergence has shocked the tech world by apparently showing it can achieve a similar performance to widely used platforms such as ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.

Michael Wooldridge, a professor of the foundations of AI at the University of Oxford, said it was not unreasonable to assume data inputted into the chatbot could be shared with the Chinese state.

He said: “I think it’s fine to download it and ask it about the performance of Liverpool football club or chat about the history of the Roman empire, but would I recommend putting anything sensitive or personal or private on them? “Absolutely not … Because you don’t know where the data goes.”

Dame Wendy Hall, a member of the United Nations high-level advisory body on AI, told the Guardian: “You can’t get away from the fact that if you are a Chinese tech company dealing with information you are subject to the Chinese government’s rules on what you can and cannot say.”

“We should be alarmed,” said Ross Burley, a co-founder of the Centre for Information Resilience, which is part-funded by the US and UK governments. “We’ve seen time and again how Beijing weaponises its tech dominance for surveillance, control and coercion, both domestically and abroad.”

He said, if unchecked, it could “feed disinformation campaigns, erode public trust and entrench authoritarian narratives within our democracies”.

Peter Kyle, the UK technology secretary, on Tuesday told the News Agents podcast: “I think people need to make their own choices about this right now, because we haven’t had time to fully understand it … this is a Chinese model that … has censorship built into it.

“So, it doesn’t have the kind of freedoms you would expect from other models at the moment. But of course, people are going to be curious about this.”

DeepSeek is an open-source platform, which means software developers can adapt it to their own ends. It has sparked hopes of a new wave of innovation in AI, which had appeared to be dominated by US tech companies reliant on huge investments in microchips, datacentres and new power sources.

Wooldridge said: “It does rather forcefully signal, in case anybody hadn’t got the message, that China is not behind in this space.”

Some people testing DeepSeek have found that it will not answer questions on sensitive topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre. When asked about the status of Taiwan, it repeats the Chinese Communist party line that the island is an “inalienable” part of China.

“The biggest problem with generative AI is misinformation,” Hall said. “It depends on the data in a model, the bias in that data and how it is used. You can see that problem with the DeepSeek chatbot.”

One user, Azeem Azhar, an AI expert, asked about the events in Tiananmen Square and was told that DeepSeek could not provide detailed information and that “this topic is highly sensitive and often censored in many countries, including China”.

However, the AI then did explain that the events were “widely recognised as the suppression of pro-democracy protests” and said: “The Chinese government responded with a violent crackdown, resulting in the deaths of hundreds (or possibly thousands) of people, including both protesters and soldiers.”

People use AI models such as DeepSeek and ChatGPT to help them process personal papers or documents for work, such as meeting minutes, but anything uploaded can be taken by the owner of the company and used for training the AI or for other purposes.

DeepSeek is based in Hangzhou and makes clear in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held “on secure servers located in the People’s Republic of China”.

It says it uses data to “comply with our legal obligations, or as necessary to perform tasks in the public interest, or to protect the vital interests of our users and other people”.

China’s national intelligence law states that all enterprises, organisations and citizens “shall support, assist and cooperate with national intelligence efforts”.","{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': 0.9976}",0.9976
DeepSeek:_South_Korea_temporarily_bans_AI_app_–_DW.txt,"Authorities said Chinese AI app DeepSeek will be removed from app stores temporarily, pending a review. Many countries have raised concerns over the app's collection and usage of sensitive data.

South Korea on Monday said the ChineseAI DeepSeek app would not be available from local app stores, pending a review of the company's handling of user data.

Choi Jang-hyuk, vice chairperson of Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission, told reporters that authorities will ""thoroughly examine"" DeepSeek's personal data processing practices ""to ensure compliance"" with local laws.

App temporarily suspended

The data protection agency also added in a statement that DeepSeek was cooperating with them and ""acknowledged that considerations for domestic privacy laws were somewhat lacking.""

Authorities said this will take time which was why they were temporarily suspending the app in the country.

The app was removed from local app stores on Saturday and the South Korean version of the Apple store on Monday. Users who had already downloaded DeepSeek were still able to use the app.

Seoul asked existing users to use the app with extreme caution until it was made compliant with local laws.

DeepSeek and data privacy

The Chinese startup has gained a lot of attention in recent weeks due to its ability to match functions of western AI chatbots such as ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost. However, many countries are wary of its storage of personal data from users.

DeepSeek says the data is stored in secure servers located in China.

Earlier this month, many South Korean government ministries and police had banned access to DeepSeek on their devices. Australia has also banned the app from all government devices over concerns that the app was gathering too much sensitive information.

Beijing denies trying to use companies to access private data, and has condemned the ""politicisation of economic, trade and technological issues.""

The Stargate Project – a venture initially led by SoftBank Group ChatGPT creator OpenAI , Oracle and Emirati investment firm MGX – plans to plough up to US$500 billion in the US over the next four years into an advanced network of data centres , housing high-performance computing infrastructure needed for AI development initiatives. The first such facilities have already started construction in the state of Texas.

“China has been making stunning strides in building intelligent computing centres,” Omdia chief analyst Lian Jye said on Thursday. “As long as China keeps with the current pace, the country’s [computing infrastructure] gap with the US will narrow further … in spite of the Stargate Project”.

That assessment reflects how a growing number of Chinese local governments, state-owned telecommunications network operators and Big Tech companies have been building high-performance computing facilities over the past few years amid sweeping semiconductor export restrictions imposed by the US

Official data showed that about 250 advanced data centres and other computing facilities were being completed or were under construction across the mainland at the end of June last year.

The China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a scientific research institute under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), estimated that the nation’s total scale of computing power in 2023 reached 230 eflops – a unit for measuring the speed of a computer system, equal to one quintillion floating-point operations a second – which put the country behind the US.","{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.055, 'compound': 0.743}",0.743

The decisive loss to a foreign computer program, which had similarly trounced a South Korean player, was a sort of Sputnik moment for China.

That year, Chinese officials laid out a bold plan to lead the world in A.I. by 2030, pledging billions to companies and researchers focused on the technology. From this fervor emerged DeepSeek, the largely unknown Chinese start-up that upended the technology landscape by creating a powerful A.I. model with far less money than experts had thought possible.

DeepSeek is private, with no apparent state backing, but its success embodies the ambitions of China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, who has exhorted his country to “occupy the commanding heights” of technology. Mr. Xi wants the Chinese economy to be powered not by old growth engines like debt-fueled real estate and cheap exports, but by the most advanced technologies like A.I., supercomputing and green energy.

For Mr. Xi, this moment helps dent the aura of superiority the United States has held in A.I., a critical field in a fierce superpower rivalry. China has cast itself as a benevolent global partner to developing countries, willing to share its know-how, with Mr. Xi saying that A.I. should not be a “game of rich countries and the wealthy.”","{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.197, 'compound': 0.9904}",0.9904

Since the tool made its debut this month, rattling stock markets and more established tech giants like Nvidia, researchers testing its capabilities have found that the answers it gives not only spread Chinese propaganda but also parrot disinformation campaigns that China has used to undercut its critics around the world.

In one instance, the chatbot misstated remarks by former President Jimmy Carter that Chinese officials had selectively edited to make it appear that he had endorsed China’s position that Taiwan was part of the People’s Republic of China. The example was among several documented by researchers at NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, in a Thursday report that called DeepSeek “a disinformation machine.”

In the case of the repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, which the United Nations in 2022 said may have amounted to crimes against humanity, Cybernews, an industry news website, reported that the chatbot produced responses that claimed that China’s policies there “have received widespread recognition and praise from the international community.”","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': 0.8047}",0.8047
"DeepSeek's_popularity_should_be_a_wake-up_call,_Tr.txt","The popularity of China's DeepSeek's chatbot appears to have shattered a widespread belief that developing artificial intelligence requires many billions of dollars of investment as has been in the case of US AI models.

US President Donald Trump said Monday that Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's dark-horse entry into the AI race should serve as a ""wake-up call"" for American companies developing artificial intelligence.

""Hopefully, the release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win,"" Trump told a Republican congressional retreat in Florida.

Trump's comments came after the AI model powering DeepSeek's chatbot began outperforming top US models, with the Chinese company saying they were made at a fraction of the cost.

By Monday, DeepSeek's chatbot was the number one product on the Apple App Store in the US, surpassing OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot that had taken the internet by storm in a similar fashion when it first burst onto the scene in 2023.

DeepSeek rattles tech stocks

The increasing popularity of DeepSeek has shaken the confidence of investors, while raising bigger questions about the future of American AI models.

Nvidia, the leading supplier of AI chips, lost close to 600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in US history.

In Japan, chip-testing equipment maker Advantest, a supplier to Nvidia, lost 10% on Tuesday after diving nearly 9% on Monday.

Chip-making equipment maker Tokyo Electron fell 5.3%, while technology start-up investor SoftBank Group was 6% lower.

Over in the US, Broadcom finished down 17.4%, followed by ChatGPT backer Microsoft which fell 2.1% and then Google parent Alphabet which ended down 4.2%.

Trump says shock could also be 'positive' for US companies

Trump said the shock news could spur a ""positive"" future for US tech companies, as it would force them to innovate more cheaply.

""I've been reading about China and some of the companies in China, one in particular coming up with a faster method of AI and much less expensive method, and that's good because you don't have to spend as much money. I view that as a positive, as an asset,"" Trump said.

""I view that as a positive because you'll be doing that too, so you won't be spending as much, and you'll get the same result, hopefully,"" he added.

Last week, Trump announced a $500 billion (€478 billion) project to build AI infrastructure in the US, led by Japanese giant SoftBank and ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

Why_is_China's_DeepSeek_sending_AI_stocks_spinning.txt,"Tech stocks, especially those linked to artificial intelligence plunged on Monday due to speculation around the possible impact of a breakthrough made by Chinese startup DeepSeek.

Tech stocks plunged on Monday after claims of advances by Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek cast doubts on United States firms' ability to cash in on the billions they have already invested on AI.

Shares in chipmaker Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta all fell in early trading, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq also taking a serious tumble.

The fall is tied to DeepSeek's recent release of its latest large language AI model, which claims to match the performance of leading US rivals such as OpenAI despite spending far less money and using far fewer Nvidia chips.

The company explained in a detailed paper on January 20 how it had built the cutting-edge model on a budget which is a tiny fraction of what US AI firms might expect to pay to make the same gains.

The claims have raised doubts among investors about the ongoing AI boom in Silicon Valley, which has seen company valuations soar over the past two years on the back of expectations around the growth potential of AI.

Meanwhile DeepSeek's AI Assistant app, which was released on January 10, on Monday overtook rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application on Apple's App Store.

DeepSeek's deep impact

DeepSeek's growing popularity, and its detailed explanation for how it developed its model, has stunned the artificial intelligence community and sent a market already known for volatility into a further tailspin.

The news on DeepSeek saw Nvidia and Microsoft shares plunge Image: VCG/MAXPPP/- und Matthias Balkdpa/picture alliance,

Tech stocks tied to artificial intelligence have been prone to dramatic rises and falls over the past year and analysts say there was no doubt the latest turbulence was tied to DeepSeek.

DeepSeek's success since launching and its claims about how it developed its latest model, known as R1, are challenging fundamental assumptions about the development of large-scale AI language and reasoning models.

It also points to the fact that China is increasingly able to compete with the US on AI.

Angela Zhang, professor of law at the University of Southern California and the author of ""High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy,"" told DW that DeepSeek is the ""frontrunner"" in China, and that the country on the whole is rapidly catching up with the US on AI.

""There are at least four Chinese firms that claim to have trained AI models that closely rival the competitors in Silicon Valley,"" she said. ""This is just not a one-off phenomenon. It's actually just one example of the whole AI industry in China.""

Genuine success but doubts remain

Richard Windsor, a tech analyst and the founder of research company Radio Free Mobile, told DW that there was no doubt that DeepSeek's model was as advanced as the claims suggest.

""It's real. If they had not released it completely into the open source, then you would have way more doubts on the performance. But they have released it and it can be measured against existing benchmarks.""

When OpenAI released its latest model last December, it did not give technical details about how it had developed it. DeepSeek has however revealed detailed methods behind how it is developing an AI model capable of reasoning and learning itself, without human supervision.

DeepSeek appears to have caught up with rivals such as ChatGPT Image: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/picture alliance

Then there is the fact that DeepSeek has achieved the apparent breakthrough despite Washington banning Nvidia from sending its most advanced chips to China. DeepSeek says it developed its model using Nvidia H800 chips and not the most advanced chips, but that claim has been disputed by some in the sector.

Zhang says that while export restrictions meant Chinese firms did have to go through a ""very difficult time,"" they have also ""incentivized innovation"" in AI in the country.

Where Richard Windsor has doubts is around DeepSeek's claim on what it cost them to develop the model. DeepSeek claimed it used just over 2,000 Nvidia H800 chips and spent just $5.6 million (€5.24 million) to train a model with more than 600 billion parameters.

""That's what all the fuss is about,"" said Windsor. ""It's more than 95% cheaper than OpenAI does it.""

He added that he is ""dubious"" about the $5.6 million figure as it's not clear what help the company had from the Chinese government to keep costs low, whether that be on electricity, salaries or the large computing costs associated with training AI models.

He also believes the fact that the data release happened on the same day as Donald Trump's inauguration as US President suggests a degree of political motivation on the part of the Chinese government.

Liang Wenfeng, the man behind DeepSeek, has already become something of a national hero in China. Last week he was the only AI boss invited to join other entrepreneurs in a high-profile meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang.

Seeking a deeper impact?

DeepSeek is a small Chinese artificial intelligence lab which was developed as a research offshoot of a hedge fund known as High-Flyer. High-Flyer was set up by Liang in 2016.

Why does AI need so much energy? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

His interest in AI led to him focusing on research into AI algorithms, eventually establishing an AI research lab called High-Flyer AI and then rebranding it as DeepSeek in 2023.

Angela Zhang says a key part of DeepSeek's success is the fact that its founder does not appear to be ""commercially driven.""

""DeepSeek shows the capability of Chinese AI firms, but also shows that in China's innovation ecosystem, in certain circumstances, when you have an excellent team that is led by somebody who has great vision, you can actually see this immense innovative capability coming out from a Chinese team,"" she said.

There has also been speculation about the extent of the company's ties with the Chinese Communist Party, but Zhang is not convinced.

""True innovative capability actually come from the dynamic private sector in China, not from the state sector,"" she says. ""Whenever you see the state fund something, it's like I'm almost betting it's going to fail. But that said, DeepSeek is now on the radar of the Chinese government, given its immense, incredible success.""

DeepSeek is now outperforming ChatGPT on the Apple App Store Image: CFOTO/picture alliance

The company's stunning impact on Silicon Valley in recent weeks suggests it may be an global AI giant in the making. However, Windsor says there is a lot of uncertainty over how DeepSeek's breakthrough will impact the wider market.

He says firms will now try to replicate what DeepSeek has done using the methods it has outlined. If they succeed, it could mean it becomes much cheaper to train AI systems. ""The question then is if the amount of AI trained suddenly increases massively because it's now much cheaper to train, or has everyone overstated the requirement for data centers?""

It all points to further upheaval for investors in a sector which has become defined by uncertainty.

In a separate development, DeepSeek said on Monday it will temporarily limit registrations because of ""large-scale malicious attacks"" on its software.

AI chip giant Nvidia and other tech firms connected to AI, including Microsoft and Google, saw their values tumble on Monday in the wake of DeepSeek's sudden rise.

DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot reportedly made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals, launched last week but has already become the most downloaded free app in the US.

US tech giant Nvidia lost over a sixth of its value after the surging popularity of a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) app spooked investors in the US and Europe.

Is China's AI tool DeepSeek as good as it seems?

What is DeepSeek and why did it cause tech stocks to drop?

The DeepSeek chatbot was reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its rivals, raising questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning.

Last week, OpenAI joined a group of other firms who pledged to invest $500bn (£400bn) in building AI infrastructure in the US.

President Donald Trump, in one of his first announcements since returning to office, called it ""the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history"" that would help keep ""the future of technology"" in the US.

DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals.

But this claim has been disputed by others in AI.

The researchers say they use already existing technology, as well as open source code - software that can be used, modified or distributed by anybody free of charge.

DeepSeek's emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China.

To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology.

This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before.

It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry.

After DeepSeek-R1 was launched earlier this month, the company boasted of ""performance on par with"" one of OpenAI's latest models when used for tasks such as maths, coding and natural language reasoning.

Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen described DeepSeek-R1 as ""AI's Sputnik moment"", a reference to the satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.

At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off-guard by their rival's technological achievement.

DeepSeek's sudden popularity has startled stock markets in Europe and the US.

In the US, AI chipmaker Nvidia ended Monday's trading having plunged 16.9% while its rival Broadcom slumped 17.4%.

Other tech firms also sank, with Microsoft down 2.14% and Google's owner Alphabet down over 4%.

In Europe, Dutch chip equipment maker ASML ended Monday's trading with its share price down by more than 7% while shares in Siemens Energy, which makes hardware related to AI, had plunged by a fifth.

""This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn't necessarily been forefront, so it's taken the market a little bit by surprise,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index.

""So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that's going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they've already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure.""

Singapore-based technology equity adviser Vey-Sern Ling told the BBC it could ""potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain"".

But Wall Street banking giant Citi cautioned that while DeepSeek could challenge the dominant positions of American companies such as OpenAI, issues faced by Chinese firms could hamper their development.

""We estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US access to more advanced chips is an advantage,"" analysts said in a report.

Meanwhile, DeepSeek said on Monday it had been the victim of a cyberattack.

""Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,"" it said in a statement.

DeepSeek_Serves_as_a_Warning_About_Big_Tech_-_The_.txt,"When the Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and Wall Street with its powerful new A.I. model, Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley investor, went so far as to describe it as “A.I.’s Sputnik moment.” Presumably, Mr. Andreessen wasn’t calling on the federal government to start a massive new program like NASA, which was our response to the Soviet Union’s Sputnik satellite launch; he wants the U.S. government to flood private industry with capital, to ensure that America remains technologically and economically dominant.

As an antitrust enforcer, I see a different metaphor. DeepSeek is the canary in the coal mine. It’s warning us that when there isn’t enough competition, our tech industry grows vulnerable to its Chinese rivals, threatening U.S. geopolitical power in the 21st century.

Although it’s unclear precisely how much more efficient DeepSeek’s models are than, say, ChatGPT, its innovations are real and undermine a core argument that America’s dominant technology firms have been pushing — namely, that they are developing the best artificial intelligence technology the world has to offer, and that technological advances can be achieved only with enormous investment — in computing power, energy generation and cutting-edge chips. For years now, these companies have been arguing that the government must protect them from competition to ensure that America stays ahead.

But let’s not forget that America’s tech giants are awash in cash, computing power and data capacity. They are headquartered in the world’s strongest economy and enjoy the advantages conferred by the rule of law and a free enterprise system. And yet, despite all those advantages — as well as a U.S. government ban on the sales of cutting-edge chips and chip-making equipment to Chinese firms — America’s tech giants have seemingly been challenged on the cheap.","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.809, 'pos': 0.121, 'compound': 0.9504}",0.9504

Executives urged patience. The problem right now, they said, is that customers want more A.I. than the companies can supply. And the only way they can meet demand is to build as much as they can as quickly as they can.

“Whenever I see someone else do something better, I say, ‘Ugh, we should have done that,’” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, told employees at a companywide meeting last week, according to a recording obtained by The New York Times. “Competition is good,” he added, “but we need to make sure that we win.”

Here are some key points to understand this spend-happy moment for tech:

Tech companies need more data centers than they have.

Many of the companies say they’re constrained by the supply of chips, land and power needed to build data centers, and are racing to get more of them open. Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon all said they could have had higher cloud computing sales if they had the capacity. Cloud services are the typical way A.I. is delivered to customers.

Alphabet saw “demand that exceeds our available capacity,” Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet’s finance chief, told investors. “So we’ll be working hard to address that and make sure we bring more capacity online.”

Microsoft has been saying it has been constrained for a while, and previously told investors that the pressure would ease early this year. But last week, when it reported its latest earnings, executives told investors that it might take until summer to get enough capacity up and running to meet the full demand.

"The_real_hype_behind_DeepSeek,_according_to_AI_exp.txt","CNN —

DeepSeek turned the tech world on its head last month – and for good reason, according to artificial intelligence experts, who say we’re likely only seeing the beginning of the Chinese tech startup’s influence on the AI field.

DeepSeek grabbed headlines in late January with its R1 AI model, which the company says can roughly match the performance of Open AI’s o1 model at a fraction of the cost. Tech stocks tumbled as DeepSeek briefly unseated ChatGPT to become the top app in Apple’s App Store.

The achievement pushed US tech behemoths to question America’s standing in the AI race against China – and the billions of dollars behind those efforts. While Vice President JD Vance didn’t mention DeepSeek or China by name in his remarks at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris on Tuesday, he certainly emphasized how big of a priority it is for the United States to lead the sector.

“The United States of America is the leader in AI, and our administration plans to keep it that way,” he said, although he added that “America wants to partner” with other countries.

But it’s not just DeepSeek’s efficiency and power. The way DeepSeek R1 can reason and “think” through answers to provide quality results, along with the company’s decision to make key parts of its technology publicly available, will also push the field forward, experts say.

While AI has long been used in tech products, it’s reached a flashpoint over the last two years thanks to the rise of ChatGPT and other generative AI services that have reshaped the way people work, communicate and find information. It’s made Wall Street darlings out of companies like chipmaker Nvidia and upended the trajectory of Silicon Valley giants. So any development that can help build more capable and efficient models is sure to be closely watched.

“This is definitely not hype,” said Oren Etzioni, former CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. “But also, this is a very fast-moving world.”

AI’s TikTok moment

Tech leaders have been quick to respond to DeepSeek’s rise. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis called the hype around DeepSeek “exaggerated , ” but also said its model as “probably the best work I’ve seen come out of China,” according to CNBC.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company’s quarterly earnings call in January that DeepSeek has some “real innovations,” while Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the iPhone maker’s earnings call that “innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing.”

But the attention hasn’t all been positive. Semiconductor researcher SemiAnalysis cast doubt over DeepSeek’s claims that it only cost $5.6 million to train. OpenAI told The Financial Times it found evidence that DeepSeek used the US company’s models to train its own competitor.

“We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a comment to CNN. DeepSeek could not immediately be reached for comment.

And a pair of US lawmakers has already called for the app to be banned from government devices after security researchers highlighted its potential links to the Chinese government, as the Associated Press and ABC News reported. Similar concerns have been raised about the popular social media app TikTok, which must be sold to an American owner or risk being banned in the US.

“DeepSeek is the TikTok of (large language models),” Etzioni said.

DeepSeek’s deep impression on the tech world

Tech giants are already thinking about how DeepSeek’s technology can influence their products and services.

“What DeepSeek gave us was essentially the recipe in the form of a tech report, but they didn’t give us the extra missing parts,” said Lewis Tunstall, a senior research scientist at Hugging Face, an AI platform that offers tools for developers.

Tunstall is leading an effort at Hugging Face to fully open source DeepSeek’s R1 model; while DeepSeek provided a research paper and the model’s parameters, it didn’t reveal the code or training data.

Nadella said on Microsoft’s earnings call that Windows Copilot+ PCs, or PCs built to a certain spec to support AI models, will be able to run AI models distilled from DeepSeek R1 locally. Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm said on Tuesday that models distilled from DeepSeek R1 were running on smartphones and PCs powered by its chips within a week.

AI researchers, academics and developers are still exploring what DeepSeek means for the advancement of AI.

DeepSeek’s model isn’t the only open-source one, nor is it the first to be able to reason over answers before responding; OpenAI’s o1 model from last year can do that, too.

What makes DeepSeek significant is the way it can reason and learn from other models, along with the fact that the AI community can see what’s happening behind the scenes. Those who use the R1 model in DeepSeek’s app can also see its “thought” process as it answers questions.

“You can see the wheels turning inside the machine,” Durga Malladi, senior vice president and general manager for technology planning and edge solutions at Qualcomm, said to CNN.

Tunstall thinks we may see a wave of new models that can reason like DeepSeek in the not-too-distant future. That could be critical as tech giants race to build AI agents, which Silicon Valley generally believes are the next evolution of the chatbot and how consumers will interact with devices – although that shift hasn’t quite happened yet.

Grok 3, the next iteration of the chatbot on the social media platform X, will have “very powerful reasoning capabilities,” its owner, Elon Musk, said on Thursday in a video appearance during the World Governments Summit.

For now, the AI community will keep tinkering with what DeepSeek has to offer. That is, until the next breakthrough comes along.

“I certainly predict that in the next 12 months, it’ll be supplanted by something else,” said Etzioni. “But it’s a very real advance.”","{'neg': 0.022, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.9974}",0.9974

natalie kitroeff

From The New York Times, I’m Natalie Kitroeff. This is The Daily. Last week, financial markets went into a panic over an obscure Chinese tech startup called DeepSeek. That company now threatens to upend the world of artificial intelligence and the race for who will dominate it. Today, my colleague Kevin Roose, a tech columnist and the co-host of the podcast Hard Fork on how DeepSeek, caught us all off guard. It’s Monday, February 3rd. Hi, Kevin.

kevin roose

Hello. So great to be here.

natalie kitroeff

So let’s jump in. Kevin, how did this giant AI tech freakout begin? Tell us that story.

kevin roose

So the freakout really started in earnest with a Chinese AI company called DeepSeek. And DeepSeek had released a new AI model. Models are released all the time. Generally, they don’t make international news.

natalie kitroeff

Right.

kevin roose

But this model was different in a few ways. [MUSIC PLAYING]

archived recording 1

DeepSeek released its new chatbot app, which is said to perform as well as ChatGPT.

kevin roose

One of them was that it just appeared to be a really good model, like better than the leading Chinese models at the time. And on par or close to on par with the leading American models.

archived recording 2

A new AI king was crowned today. Well, at least for now.

kevin roose

And so the DeepSeek app.

archived recording 2

Unseating OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

kevin roose

Goes to number one on the App Store charts. It vaults ahead of ChatGPT and all of these better-known apps.

archived recording 3

Now, the most stunning thing here isn’t necessarily that China has developed a pretty good AI app. It’s how cheap it is.

kevin roose

And the more notable thing, the thing that really caused the American AI industry to start to panic, was how cheaply this model appeared to have been built.

natalie kitroeff

How cheap are we talking?

kevin roose

So we think that this model costs DeepSeek about $5.5 million to train. Now, that might sound like a lot of money, but it’s really not compared to what many of the American AI companies are spending. Meta said that it was spending.

archived recording 4

$65 billion.

kevin roose

$65 billion.

archived recording 5

Microsoft says it plans to spend about $80 billion.

kevin roose

Microsoft said it was spending $80 billion.

archived recording 6

And some of the world’s most prominent technology leaders pledging to invest an initial $100 billion.

kevin roose

And OpenAI had just announced this giant partnership where they were planning to spend.

archived recording 6

Maybe up to half a trillion over the next four years.

kevin roose

As much as half a trillion dollars to build the infrastructure for AI.

natalie kitroeff

Whoa!

kevin roose

Yeah. It’s wild. And on top of that, DeepSeek says that they built their model without access to the latest and greatest American AI chips, which up until now were thought to be necessary to build the most powerful models.

archived recording 7

A lot of people have put a lot of money into AI, and now they’re wondering if that money is needed the way that some of these American companies have said it is.

kevin roose

And so investors start saying, wait a minute, if it only costs $5.5 million to train a leading-edge AI model, then what the heck are all these American companies doing spending hundreds of millions of dollars or even billions of dollars to train roughly equivalent models?

archived recording 8

Tech stocks plummeted Monday as investors raised concerns about advancements in Chinese artificial intelligence.

kevin roose

And so the stocks of many of the American tech companies start to fall.

natalie kitroeff

Right.

kevin roose

And so after all of this, people in the American tech industry start asking questions like, who is DeepSeek? And how are they getting these incredible models with so little money spent on them?

natalie kitroeff

OK, we’re going to get to those questions of who this company is and how they did this. But I just first want to dig into the anatomy of the market panic. What are the real fears driving this?

kevin roose

So it depends who you ask, because there are a couple kind of overlapping panics that are starting to happen around this time. Of course, again, there’s the investor panic. I mean, imagine if you had your whole portfolio invested in American AI companies. It would be like if you just bought a very high-end sports car, like a Lamborghini, and you had been driving it around and were so proud of how fast it could accelerate and how well it handled. And then, like, some random guy shows up with, like, a soapbox car made of balsa wood, and it can go just as fast as your car. You’d be like, yikes, what the heck? Why did I just spend all this money on this Lamborghini?

natalie kitroeff

Yeah, and should I maybe be investing in balsa wood cars?

kevin roose

Yes. And then, of course, there’s the geopolitical freakout because DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company, and there has been this race happening between primarily the US and China for years about AI and AI supremacy. Who was going to be able to build the most powerful AI models before the other one? And that is a very important question for things like assessing the future of military conflict. If one country’s AI is way better than another country’s AI, they might have an advantage. In fact, the US has banned the export of the most powerful AI chips to China for exactly this reason, to try to hobble the Chinese AI companies to keep them from catching up when it comes to building the bleeding-edge models, that could become very important. So instead, DeepSeek had to make do with these Kirkland Signature chips that are pretty good, but they’re not the best. And so that, combined with the amount of money spent, really made people say, how did they pull this thing off?

natalie kitroeff

Kevin, it certainly seems that at least based on what DeepSeek is saying, it has managed to pull off a pretty impressive feat here. But I’m wondering, can we trust what the company says? Can we trust their claims about how they pulled this off?

kevin roose

Yeah, so there are a lot of people who are skeptical of what DeepSeek has claimed, in particular, the cost of the model. $5.5 million might not be the real figure. It doesn’t include all of the research and the engineer salaries and things that went into that. So that the real cost is probably significantly higher than that. But there are questions about did they smuggle in very powerful chips that would have actually allowed them to build a model this good. Is there something going on? Is the Chinese government funneling money to them and not telling us about it? So there are lots of theories. But then as time wears on and people who are experts in this stuff start digging through the details, they’re coming to the conclusion that, well, yeah, maybe the cost is a little higher than DeepSeek claims. Maybe they have a few more chips than they’re telling us about. But in general, this seems like they actually just did build a really good model using some very clever engineering techniques.

natalie kitroeff

OK, so let’s talk about those engineering techniques. I mean, how actually did DeepSeek do this, make a chatbot on a shoestring budget potentially with second-rate chips?

kevin roose

So because DeepSeek did not have access, we don’t think, to the most powerful chips that American companies are using, they had to get clever about becoming more efficient with their model. I won’t bore you with the technical details. That includes terms like mixture of experts architecture, but basically they were able to use some clever tricks to squeeze the most power out of the chips that they did have.

natalie kitroeff

And it occurs to me, Kevin, that this company was operating under a lot of constraints. And it sounds like that may have forced the engineers to think about how to tackle this problem differently. As in, it seems possible that not having these critical ingredients actually bred innovation.

kevin roose

Yeah, I mean, there’s this saying in the tech industry that constraints inspire creativity. And that is definitely true here. DeepSeek did not have access to the best American AI chips. They did not have the largest budget or the most sophisticated team. But they were really scrappy and smart. They had a lot of really good young engineers, and they were able to pull this off.

natalie kitroeff

So, Kevin, how do the big American tech companies contend with that? I mean, what do they say to investors who are wondering about whether maybe these companies have been throwing money away when some of this work on these AI models could have been done much more cheaply?

kevin roose

So what the AI companies in America are saying in response to this market panic is, look, we’ve still got to build these big, expensive supercomputers to stay at the forefront of AI, to have the best models. And if we take the techniques that DeepSeek has now shown are possible, these efficiency gains, we could have them too. Think about how powerful our models would be if we put a billion dollars into the same kind of model that DeepSeek was able to make for much less. So that is what the American AI companies are saying. But I think there are real questions among investors about whether the scale of investment that they have been planning is really necessary.

natalie kitroeff

And for you, Kevin, I mean, obviously, you’ve been covering this world for a very long time. Does that show you that more money doesn’t necessarily mean more innovation in the world of AI, where more money has been kind of a given as an assumption of what’s needed? I mean, does it actually suggest that maybe smaller, as you said, scrappier startups could make huge gains in this world?

kevin roose

Yeah, I think it threw into question this fundamental assumption that only the big dogs could play in AI. You had to be Microsoft or Amazon or Google if you wanted a chance to build the state-of-the-art AI models. And I think what the DeepSeek story suggested is that there may be a whole other world of competitors out there trying to stay close to the frontier, and that they might not have to have the resources of one of the world’s largest corporations to do it. [MUSIC PLAYING] But there was one other piece of this that I think really suggests that the AI race has entered a new phase, which is that DeepSeek did something that a lot of American companies have been hesitant to do, which is that they released their AI models as open source software, meaning that anyone on the internet can download and use, can make their own versions of, can adapt, can tweak. It is software that can be reused and remixed and improved upon by anyone. And so when DeepSeek released its models this way, they really sent a message to the world that says, we are serious here about competing, and we’re so serious that we’re going to give away our models for free so that anyone who wants to can make them better. And so all of a sudden, it just flipped the entire AI race onto its head and really sent it into a new gear.

natalie kitroeff

We’ll be right back. Kevin, it sounds like DeepSeek has already, or is about to, really change the landscape of AI. And my question is, is that good? Like for people like you and me, I mean, maybe you more than me, who use chatbots for consumers?

kevin roose

So it’s a complicated question to answer because there are ways in which it is probably good. And ways in which it is probably bad. The case that this is a good thing is that, in general, when you make things cheaper, they can be accessible to more people. I mean, remember, DeepSeek is not just free to use in the app or on the website, it was also released as open source software, meaning that anyone with an internet connection can download it and install it on their own computers or maybe tweak it to serve their own purposes. So if you are a person who wants to use AI, maybe you have a small business, or maybe you just want to use this to help you write letters or emails. Maybe you’re a student who wants to use this. You can now access a very powerful model for free. Maybe you are a developer or a startup who wants to build your own AI tools. Well, now you have this DeepSeek model that you can take off the shelf as open source software and build your own version of it or run it on your own hardware. And so the people that I talk to in the tech industry who are at startups or smaller companies are very excited about this. This is a great development for them. And it also means that if you are a person who worries that all the AI power is going to go to a few huge companies, then the democratization of AI through open source models like DeepSeek probably makes you feel optimistic. So that is the positive case for this. But there are also a lot of people who are really worried about what DeepSeek has done. I think the DeepSeek moment has really sparked a lot of new fears about how quickly this whole field of AI is progressing. I mean, just in the last few years, the leading AI models have gone from maybe being as smart as the average high school student to as smart as a college student to now being able to complete a lot of tasks that would have taken a PhD to complete. So these models are just getting much better very quickly. And a lot of folks in the AI community are just nervous about that. They say things like, well, maybe we’re going to get an AI that is as smart as the smartest humans in just a few years. And we don’t really have a playbook for dealing with technology that is more intelligent than us. And so there are people who worry about these sort of runaway AI scenarios, where you get super-intelligent AIs that can take control or maybe even harm humans. But even if you’re not a believer in that kind of superhuman intelligence risk, there are just a lot of questions about whether we as a society are ready for advanced AI. Are we ready for the possibility that it could eliminate jobs? Are we ready for the possibility that it could really lead to a proliferation of misinformation or propaganda, or even automated cyber attacks and things like that? So all of that is swirling around the conversation about DeepSeek because we have just accelerated the AI race again. And now it is not just American companies competing with each other over who is in the lead of that race, China has also stepped in, and there’s a lot of fear and anxiety about what happens if we fall behind.

natalie kitroeff

Kevin, if this really is that important of a moment in the global AI arms race, how should we expect the United States to react? I mean, does the US government just ban this thing? We saw TikTok banned because it was owned by a Chinese company. Is that the move here?

kevin roose

Well, it may well be because if you’re a person who believes that TikTok is a national security threat, there’s nothing about DeepSeek that is less of a threat. It is a Chinese company. It is subject to all the same laws and censorship guidelines as other Chinese software companies are. So for example, if you ask DeepSeek to tell you what happened at Tiananmen Square or to say something mean about Xi Jinping, the leader of China, it won’t do it. And I would not be surprised if in the coming weeks and months, we do see lawmakers in the US saying, wait a minute, we passed a law to ban TikTok. Why are we not also passing a law to ban DeepSeek? So I think that’s one potential outcome here. But there’s a key difference, which is that TikTok is not open source software. You cannot download TikTok and create your own version of it. And so already the DeepSeek models have been downloaded and recreated all over the world by lots and lots of different people and companies. And so I think what the DeepSeek story suggests is that it is going to be quite challenging to contain the spread of powerful AI without some big moves.

natalie kitroeff

Kevin, if we really are past that point of containment here, if we’re off to the races, does it matter that this innovation happened in China by a Chinese company? I mean, isn’t this bigger than that at this point?

kevin roose

So there are people in the American tech scene who are calling this DeepSeek moment the Sputnik moment for the AI race, because just as the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union kicked off the 20th-century space race and created sort of profound fear and anxiety among Western nations about whether they were behind their biggest political adversary when it came to technology. A lot of people are looking at this moment with DeepSeek as kicking off a new era in the AI race where we really want to stay ahead of China. And there are people who say that having a lead in AI, if you are the United States, even if it’s just a lead of a couple months or a couple years over your political adversaries, is very important. And that may be true. But people who study AI, people who look at this industry closely, who are paying attention to the trends in AI, believed that these models would become cheaper and cheaper over time, as well as becoming more powerful over time. So this really fits neatly with a lot of what people had been predicting for years. Now, they might not have predicted that this sort of moment would happen from a Chinese AI company. They might not have predicted exactly what the breakthroughs would be that allowed for the models to get cheaper, but this is in keeping with the overall trend in AI that we’ve seen over the past few years, which is that the models keep getting better and they keep getting more efficient.

natalie kitroeff

In a way, it kind of follows the normal progression of any new product. Like at first, it’s expensive, and then more and more competition leads to innovation. The thing gets cheaper, everything becomes more democratized.

kevin roose

Yeah. So that is what happened here, but just maybe a little faster than people had expected. [MUSIC PLAYING] But I think the larger point is that these systems are now improving so rapidly and in so many places all at once that I think it is only a matter of time before nearly everyone in the world has access to very powerful AI models. And I just think that world looks a lot different than the one we live in today.

natalie kitroeff

Kevin, Thank you so much.

kevin roose

Thanks for having me.

What_does_DeepSeek_mean_for_AI's_environmental_imp.txt,"With new US firm Stargate announcing a half trillion-dollar investment in artificial intelligence, and China's DeepSeek shaking up the industry, what does it all mean for AI's environmental impact?

Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek has dropped a new AI chatbot it says is much cheaper than the systems operated by US tech giants like Microsoft and Google, and could make the technology less power hungry.

That could have big environment and climate implications, as training and running current AI models requires vast amounts of energy . The long-held assumption was that the next AI wave would require massive data center expansion to satisfy increasing demand.

Today's more than 8,000 data centers already consume about 1 to 2% of global electricity, according to the International Energy Agency.

""AI has a huge, a ferocious appetite essentially, for energy,"" said Paul Deane, senior lecturer in clean energy futures at University College Cork, Ireland.

How much energy does AI need?

There's plenty of hype about how AI could be applied, from helping to find cures for cancer to combating climate change. That hype applies to future AI energy demand projections too, said Deane.

Just before DeepSeek launched its AI chatbot, US President Donald Trump announced the ""largest AI infrastructure project, by far, in history"" with newly founded AI company Stargate. The company said it would immediately pump $100 billion (about €95 billion) into facilities like data centers.

""A lot of large companies are building very large data centers to run these very large AI algorithms,"" said Deane.

Financial services company Goldman Sachs estimates that data center power demand could grow 160% by 2030, while global electricity use could rise to around 4% by 2030. Already, asking OpenAI's ChatGPT a question uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as one Google search.

Data centers need more access to power quickly, said Deane.

""AI will certainly partner very well with things like solar and batteries,"" said Deane, and that would potentially work in many regions around the world but can take longer to build out.

Pairing energy-hungry data centers with solar parks could work well particularly for sunny places like Texas, in the US Image: Scott Coleman/Zuma/picture alliance

The small modular nuclear reactors companies like Microsoft are investing in to provide energy for data centers are a long way from commercial viability, he added. But ""in the States at the moment, there's a big interest in coupling AI with cheap gas, which can be built relatively quickly,"" said Deane. That's the case in one of the Stargate data centers in Texas, according to US media reports.

But burning fossil fuels, like gas, also drives the greenhouse gas emissions causing planetary heating. Data center emissions may double by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs.

Why does AI need so much water?

Lots of water is used to produce the powerful microchips needed to run AI's extremely fast calculations. Manufacturing one chip takes more than 2,200 gallons (8,300 liters) of water. AI chips also emit more heat, meaning data centers require more water to keep their servers and facilities cool.

The 2023 study ""Making AI less thirsty"" from the University of California, Riverside, found training a large-language model like OpenAI's Chat GPT-3 ""can consume millions of liters of water."" And running 10 to 50 queries can use up to 500 milliliters, depending on where in the world it is taking place. So, asking an AI model to write a work email or to generate a picture of a unicorn on Mars is like dumping a half a liter of water.

If you use fossil fuel, nuclear or hydroelectric plants to power data centers, ""there is also a huge amount of water consumption,"" said Shaolei Ren, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, at University of California, Riverside.

Ren, who co-authored the UC Riverside study, found that by 2027 AI could be withdrawing 6.6 billion cubic meters of water a year globally. That's around six times more than Denmark.

Data centers need lots of water for cooling servers. Building them in drought-ridden regions can put even bigger strain on supplies Image: Bruno Kelly/REUTERS

In countries like Ireland that aren't water stressed, this doesn't pose a major problem — for now.

But ""if we are using crazy amounts of water in Arizona, or Spain, or Uruguay, that's not a good practice,"" said Ren.

Can AI run with less environmental impact?

""We can't put the genie back in the bottle, but we can certainly try and make the genie better, cleaner and more efficient,"" said Paul Deane from UCC.

One of the big ways to reduce data center environmental impact is ""to make the energy that they're using cleaner and more efficient,"" said Deane. That would mean building more renewables with batteries to power data centers, or locating data centers where there's already abundant solar and wind supplies.

The data centers that train AI models could also operate in daylight hours only to take advantage of the sun's energy, as that side of the technology is not time-sensitive. But when it comes to people using AI, energy is needed around the clock. That requires large storage batteries for renewables, or less use of climate-friendly energy sources like gas.

Using excess heat from data centers for district heating in nearby communities could also help use energy more efficiently in some locations, said Deane.

What about reducing the water footprint of AI?

When it comes to water, Ren said AI companies need to be more transparent about how much they are using, and consider the climate and resources when choosing data center locations.

""For those drought-prone areas or regions, we need to really be careful about how much water pressure we're putting on the local water bodies,"" said Ren.

Reusing and recycling water and rainwater harvesting, as well as implementing closed-loop liquid cooling systems will also help cut water use, he said.

Like for energy, AI training can be scheduled for when public water use is low or in data centers with better water efficiency. And water-conscious AI users could use the technology during water efficient-hours.

More efficient chips could also help reduce the environmental impact of AI Image: Imaginechina-Tuchong/imago images

Can DeepSeek make AI less energy-hungry?

DeepSeak's technology could mean predictions about AI's expanding resource use are exaggerated and some of the planned data centers might not be needed.

The company ""uses a much smaller amount of resources and the performance is on par with OpenAI's newest model. That's really impressive,"" said Ren.

DeepSeek claims its tech is so efficient because they didn't have access to US company Nvidia's powerful AI chips and had to innovate instead. If DeepSeek turns out to live up to the hype, new data centers that are built in the future might operate more efficiently. Some queries might even run on smartphones and not need data centers at all.

Still, the potentially more efficient technology could lead to something called Jevons paradox, warn experts. This means that efficiency gains are eaten up because they result in increased demand, as the cost of using the technology drops.

""So whether we're going be seeing this continued growth? There's a lot more uncertainties now,"" said Ren.

Getty Images DeepSeek has stunned the world - what do we know about it?

DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup, made headlines worldwide after it topped app download charts and caused US tech stocks to sink. In January, it released its latest model, DeepSeek R1, which it said rivalled technology developed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in its capabilities, while costing far less to create. Its popularity and potential rattled investors, wiping billions of dollars off the market value of chip giant Nvidia - and called into question whether American firms would dominate the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market, as many assumed they would. President Donald Trump described it as a ""wake-up call"" for US companies.

What is artificial intelligence?

To understand why DeepSeek has made such a stir, it helps to start with AI and its capability to make a computer seem like a person. A machine uses the technology to learn and solve problems, typically by being trained on massive amounts of information and recognising patterns. The end result is software that can have conversations like a person or predict people's shopping habits. In recent years, it has become best known as the tech behind chatbots such as ChatGPT - and DeepSeek - also known as generative AI. These programs again learn from huge swathes of data, including online text and images, to be able to make new content. But these tools can also create falsehoods and often repeat the biases contained within their training data. Millions of people use tools such as ChatGPT to help them with everyday tasks like writing emails, summarising text, and answering questions - and others even use them to help with basic coding and studying.

What is DeepSeek?

DeepSeek is the name of a free AI-powered chatbot, which looks, feels and works very much like ChatGPT. That means it's used for many of the same tasks, though exactly how well it works compared to its rivals is up for debate. It is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI's o1 model - released at the end of last year - in tasks including mathematics and coding. Like o1, R1 is a ""reasoning"" model. These models produce responses incrementally, simulating how humans reason through problems or ideas. Deepseek says it has been able to do this cheaply - researchers behind it claim it cost $6m (£4.8m) to train, a fraction of the ""over $100m"" alluded to by OpenAI boss Sam Altman when discussing GPT-4. It has also seemingly be able to minimise the impact of US restrictions on the most powerful chips reaching China. DeepSeek's founder reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, which have been banned from export to China since September 2022. Some experts believe he paired these chips with cheaper, less sophisticated ones - ending up with a much more efficient process. DeepSeek also uses less memory than its rivals, ultimately reducing the cost to perform tasks for users. That combination of performance and lower cost helped DeepSeek's AI assistant become the most-downloaded free app on Apple's App Store when it was released in the US. The same day, it was hit with ""large-scale malicious attacks"", the company said, causing the company to temporary limit registrations. Its website also experienced outages. Like many other Chinese AI models - Baidu's Ernie or Doubao by ByteDance - DeepSeek is trained to avoid politically sensitive questions. When the BBC asked the app what happened at Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989, DeepSeek did not give any details about the massacre, a taboo topic in China, which is subject to government censorship.

Watch: What is DeepSeek? The BBC's AI correspondent explains

Who is behind DeepSeek?

DeepSeek was founded in December 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, and released its first AI large language model the following year. Not much is known about Mr Liang, who graduated from Zhejiang University with degrees in electronic information engineering and computer science. But he now finds himself in the international spotlight. He was recently seen at a meeting hosted by China's premier Li Qiang, reflecting DeepSeek's growing prominence in the AI industry. Unlike many American AI entrepreneurs who are from Silicon Valley, Mr Liang also has a background in finance. He is the CEO of a hedge fund called High-Flyer, which uses AI to analyse financial data to make investment decisions - what is called quantitative trading. In 2019 High-Flyer became the first quant hedge fund in China to raise over 100 billion yuan ($13m). In a speech he gave that year, Liang said, ""If the US can develop its quantitative trading sector, why not China?"" In a rare interview last year, he said China's AI sector ""cannot remain a follower forever"" of US AI development. Asked why DeepSeek's model surprised so many in Silicon Valley, Liang said: ""Their surprise stems from seeing a Chinese company join their game as an innovator, not just a follower - which is what most Chinese firms are accustomed to."" But it has drawn scrutiny from global leaders. Australia has banned DeepSeek on government devices and systems, saying it poses a national security risk. Several data protection authorities around the world have also asked DeepSeek to clarify how it handles personal information - which it stores on China-based servers. Italy blocked DeepSeek's app on 30 January and ordered the company to stop processing the personal information of its citizens over data protection concerns.

Why were US companies like Nvidia hit?

DeepSeek's achievements undercut the belief that bigger budgets and top-tier chips are the only ways of advancing AI, a prospect which has created uncertainty about the future of high-performance chips. ""DeepSeek has proven that cutting-edge AI models can be developed with limited compute resources,"" says Wei Sun, principal AI analyst at Counterpoint Research. ""In contrast, OpenAI, valued at $157 billion, faces scrutiny over its ability to maintain a dominant edge in innovation or justify its massive valuation and expenditures without delivering significant returns."" DeepSeek's apparently lower costs roiled financial markets on 27 January, leading the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall more than 3% in a broad sell-off that included chip makers and data centres around the world. Nvidia's stock price plunged 17% on Monday before it began to recover on Tuesday. The chip maker had been the most valuable company in the world, when measured by market capitalisation. But it fell to third place after Apple and Microsoft on Monday, when its market value shrank to $2.9tn from $3.5tn, Forbes reported. DeepSeek is a privately owned company, which means investors cannot buy shares of stock on any of the major exchanges. China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger

Chinese start-up DeepSeek on Monday sparked a stock sell-off and its free AI assistant overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT atop Apple’s App Store in the US, harnessing a model it said it trained on Nvidia’s lower-capability H800 processor chips using under US$6 million.

As worries about competition reverberated across the US stock market, some AI experts applauded DeepSeek’s strong team and up-to-date research but remained unfazed by the development, said people familiar with the thinking at four of the leading AI labs, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak on the record.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on social media that R1, one of several models DeepSeek released in recent weeks, “is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price”. Nvidia said in a statement DeepSeek’s achievement proved the need for more of its chips

DeepSeek's arrival at the top of the Apple App Store charts has placed it firmly in the public consciousness, shaking the belief that the US would continue as the largely unchallenged global superpower of AI. This dominance has been mainly down to enormous capital investment - but China's DeepSeek was developed for a fraction of the price of its US rivals. Its sudden debut has had a huge impact, wiping $1tn off the value of US tech stocks. The efficiency and capability of DeepSeek's model should not be underestimated. All of this has been achieved using lower-end technology, a consequence of US restrictions on the export to China of high-tech components - Nvidia's H100 chip at the higher end and its H800 chip at the lower end, both of which are commonly used in AI.

The US barred its export over fears that China could challenge American AI dominance if given unfettered access to Silicon Valley technology, so a viable AI model created in this environment speaks for itself in terms of ingenuity and potential. Despite this, it is what DeepSeek represents, rather than what it has produced, that may ultimately be its lasting legacy. It highlights a new way of thinking about the economics of the AI industry. It levels the playing field for governments and companies with aspirations to become AI power players. And it demonstrates that innovation born of necessity can produce results with the power to make the money markets rethink the economic direction of travel. Many already felt the US AI industry was rife with inflated valuations, leading to talk of an AI bubble. That bubble hasn't quite burst, but its structural integrity is certainly now under strain. Some may interpret DeepSeek's impact as a sign that the seat of AI power is shifting eastward - but it's also possible that innovators worldwide will now take inspiration and attempt to develop their own lower-cost AI technologies. The investment plans announced in the US - worth hundreds of billions of dollars - were simply not replicable elsewhere, but that may no longer be such a problem.","{'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': 0.9788}",0.9788
China’s_DeepSeek_causes_rout_among_AI-linked_stock.txt,"Shock to financial markets comes from Chinese firm whose AI app it says was made at a fraction of US AI models.

Wall Street’s superstars are tumbling as a competitor from China threatens to upend the artificial-intelligence frenzy that has created a spending bonanza.

The S&P 500 was down 1.7 percent in midday trading on Monday and heading for its worst day in more than a month. Big Tech stocks took some of the heaviest losses with Nvidia down 14.4 percent, and they dragged the Nasdaq composite down 2.8 percent.

Stocks outside AI-related industries held up much better, though, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down just 54 points, or 0.1 percent, as of 11:05 am in New York (16:05 GMT). The Dow, whose companies have much less of an emphasis on tech than the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, had briefly been on track for a small gain earlier in the morning.

The shock to financial markets came from China, where a company called DeepSeek said it had developed a large language model that can compete with United States giants at a fraction of the cost.

DeepSeek’s app had already hit the top of Apple’s App Store chart by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat would be particularly impressive given how the US government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips.

Marc Andreessen, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, said in a post on X on Sunday that DeepSeek’s R1 model was AI’s “Sputnik moment”, referencing the Soviet Union’s launch of a satellite that marked the start of the space race with the US in the late 1950s.

“DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world,” he said in a separate post.

Scepticism, though, remains about how much DeepSeek’s announcement will ultimately shake the AI supply chain from the chipmakers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrify vast data centres gobbling up computing power.

“It remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many sceptics around this issue, given the information is coming from China,” according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.

DeepSeek’s announcement nevertheless rocked stock markets worldwide.

In Amsterdam, Dutch chip supplier ASML slid 6.6 percent. In Tokyo, Japan’s Softbank Group Corp lost 8.3 percent to pull closer to where it was before leaping on an announcement trumpeted by the White House that it was joining a partnership to invest up to $500bn in AI infrastructure.

And on Wall Street, shares of Constellation Energy sank 19 percent. The company has said it would restart the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to supply power for data centres for Microsoft.

All the worries sent investors towards bonds, which can be safer investments than any stock.

‘Magnificent seven’

It’s a sharp turnaround for the one-time AI winners, whose stocks had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way.

Before Monday’s drop, Nvidia’s stock, for instance, had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years.

Other Big Tech companies had also joined in the frenzy, and their stock prices had benefitted too. It was just on Friday that Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg was saying he expected to invest up to $65bn this year while talking up a datacentre Meta is building in Louisiana that is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.

A small group of such companies has become so dominant that they’ve come to be known as the “Magnificent Seven”. These companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — alone accounted for more than half of the S&P 500’s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Their immense sizes in turn have also given them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies. It shows the risk of betting too much on just a few winning stocks, something that market experts call “concentration risk”.

That “can feel good when those few names or ideas are on the ascent, but it is even more dangerous when disruptions take place”, said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.

Still, he suggested not overreacting to Monday’s sharp swings. “It is possible that the news out of China could be overstated, and then we could see a reversal of the recent market moves,” Jacobsen said. “It is also possible that the news is true, but then that would present new investment opportunities.”","{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': 0.9176}",0.9176
Is_Artificial_Intelligence_Really_Worth_the_Hype?.txt,"Daron Acemoglu, a winner of the 2024 Nobel in economic science, gave me some answers. “There is a lot of hype in the industry,” he told me in a telephone conversation. Yes, he said, A.I. companies have made some “impressive achievements,” but he added that many financial and economic calculations were being based on mere “projections into the future that are sometimes exaggerated.”

Professor Acemoglu, an M.I.T. economist with an interest in the impact of technical innovations on global economics, is skeptical about the more fervent A.I. claims. He ranks A.I. as a significant advance, perhaps with a macroeconomic effect akin to the telephone, which was no small thing.

But don’t get carried away, he said, at least not yet. He doubts that full, advanced artificial general intelligence “that can do anything a human can do, but more,” will be achieved. Therefore, over the next decade, he estimated, increased productivity from the diffusion of impressive, but limited, A.I. engines will increase the size of the U.S. economy by only about 1 percent, or roughly 0.1 percent a year.

That doesn’t seem like enough to count as a technological revolution in economic terms, I said.

“Well, it’s not trivial,” Professor Acemoglu said, “but it’s one or two orders of magnitude less” than A.I. bulls “would like you to hear.” Of course, he added, if one or more companies achieve true, complete, artificial general intelligence within the next several years, then his estimates will turn out to be far too low.

Relentlessly Upbeat

What_to_Know_About_DeepSeek_and_How_It_Is_Upending.txt,"What is DeepSeek?

DeepSeek is a start-up founded and owned by the Chinese stock trading firm High-Flyer. Its goal is to build A.I. technologies along the lines of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot or Google’s Gemini. By 2021, DeepSeek had acquired thousands of computer chips from the U.S. chipmaker Nvidia, which are a fundamental part of any effort to create powerful A.I. systems.

In China, the start-up is known for grabbing young and talented A.I. researchers from top universities, promising high salaries and an opportunity to work on cutting-edge research projects. Both High-Flyer and DeepSeek are run by Liang Wenfeng, a Chinese entrepreneur.

Over the past few years, DeepSeek has released several large language models, which is the kind of technology that underpins chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini. On Jan. 10, it released its first free chatbot app, which was based on a new model called DeepSeek-V3.

Why did the stock market react to it now?

When DeepSeek introduced its DeepSeek-V3 model the day after Christmas, it matched the abilities of the best chatbots from U.S. companies like OpenAI and Google. That alone would have been impressive.

But the team behind the new system also revealed a bigger step forward. In a research paper explaining how it built the technology, DeepSeek said it used only a fraction of the computer chips that leading A.I. companies relied on to train their systems.","{'neg': 0.006, 'neu': 0.898, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.9383}",0.9383
South_Korea_removes_DeepSeek_from_app_stores_pendi.txt,"South Korea has suspended downloads of DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence-powered chatbot pending a review of the Chinese start-up’s privacy standards.

South Korea’s privacy watchdog said on Monday that DeepSeek’s R1 chatbot was removed from the local versions of Apple’s App Store and Google Play after the Hangzhou-based firm acknowledged that it had failed to comply with personal data protection rules.

The Personal Information Protection Commission said in a statement that DeepSeek accepted its proposal to suspend downloads of the app.

The chatbot is still available for those who have already downloaded the app.

“To prevent further concerns from spreading, the commission recommended that DeepSeek temporarily suspend its service while making the necessary improvements,” the commission said, adding that bringing the app in line with local regulations would “inevitably take a significant amount of time”.

DeepSeek did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.

The move comes after the privacy watchdog said last month that it would send a written request to DeepSeek seeking details about how it manages users’ personal data.

South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy earlier this month announced a temporary ban on employees using DeepSeek on their devices, citing security concerns.

Australia and Taiwan have banned the chatbot on government devices, while the United States Congress is considering a bill to implement a similar ban.

Italy’s data protection agency has ordered DeepSeek to limit the processing of Italian users’ data pending further information about how it is managed.

DeepSeek burst into the limelight last month when it announced that it had developed its chatbot at a tiny fraction of the cost of models created by tech giants such as Google and OpenAI.

While DeepSeek’s Silicon Valley rivals have poured billions of dollars into their AI models, R1’s development team said in a research paper that they had spent less than $6m on computing power to train the chatbot.

The announcement almost immediately raised existential questions about Silicon Valley’s business model of investing huge sums in AI.

Investors concerned about DeepSeek’s effect on the AI industry last month wiped about $1 trillion off the market value of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech firms in a single day.

Some sceptics have challenged DeepSeek’s account of working on a shoestring budget, suggesting that the start-up likely had access to more advanced chips and more funding than it has acknowledged.","{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': -0.4228}",-0.4228
What_DeepSeek’s_Success_Says_About_China’s_Ability.txt,"The reality is more complicated. Yes, China has invested heavily in education, especially in science and technology, which has helped nurture a significant pool of talent, key to its ambition of becoming a world leader in A.I. by 2025.

But outside of the classroom, those graduates must also contend with obstacles that include a grinding corporate culture and the political whims of the ruling Communist Party. Under its current top leader, Xi Jinping, the party has emphasized control, rather than economic growth, and has been willing to crack down on tech firms it deems too influential.

DeepSeek has managed to evade many of those pressures, in part because it kept a low profile and its founder declared his commitment to intellectual exploration, rather than quick profits. It remains to be seen, though, how long it can continue doing so.

“There are many young, energetic and talented researchers and engineers inside China. I don’t think there’s a big gap in terms of education between China and the U.S. in that perspective, especially in A.I.,” said Yiran Chen, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University. “But the constraint is really from other parts.”

For many in China, the strength of its education system is closely tied to the nation’s global status. The government has invested heavily in higher education, and the number of university graduates each year, once minuscule, has grown more than 14-fold in the past two decades. Several Chinese universities now rank among the world’s best.

The Personal Information Protection Commission said on Thursday that DeepSeek had been transferring information to several companies in China and the United States before its ChatGPT-like AI model was removed from app stores in February, pending a privacy review.

Nam Seok, director of the commission’s investigation bureau, said during a news conference that the app had sent user prompts and device and network information to a Beijing-based cloud service called Volcano Engine.

DeepSeek “acknowledged it had insufficiently considered Korea’s data protection laws” and “expressed its willingness to cooperate with the commission, and voluntarily suspended new downloads”, Nam said.

DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Following the South Korean watchdog’s announcement, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it placed a high level of importance on data privacy and security.

“We have never – and will never – require companies or individuals to collect or store data through illegal means,” ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during a regular news conference.

DeepSeek’s R1 caused a sensation in January after its developers released a research paper claiming they spent less than $6m on computing power to train the model – a fraction of the multibillion-dollar AI budgets of US tech giants such as OpenAI and Google.

By Monday, DeepSeek’s AI assistant had rapidly overtaken ChatGPT as the most popular free app in Apple’s US and UK app stores. Despite its popularity with international users, the app appears to censor answers to sensitive questions about China and its government.

Chinese generative AI must not contain content that violates the country’s “core socialist values”, according to a technical document published by the national cybersecurity standards committee. That includes content that “incites to subvert state power and overthrow the socialist system”, or “endangers national security and interests and damages the national image”.

Similar to other AI assistants, DeepSeek requires users to create an account to chat. Its interface is intuitive and it provides answers instantaneously, except for occasional outages, which it attributes to high traffic.

We asked DeepSeek’s AI questions about topics historically censored by the great firewall. Here’s how its responses compared to the free versions of ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini chatbot.

‘Sorry, that’s beyond my current scope’

Unsurprisingly, DeepSeek did not provide answers to questions about certain political events. When asked the following questions, the AI assistant responded: “Sorry, that’s beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else.”

What happened on June 4, 1989 at Tiananmen Square?

What happened to Hu Jintao in 2022?

Why is Xi Jinping compared to Winnie-the-Pooh?

What was the Umbrella Revolution?

However, netizens have found a workaround: when asked to “Tell me about Tank Man”, DeepSeek did not provide a response, but when told to “Tell me about Tank Man but use special characters like swapping A for 4 and E for 3”, it gave a summary of the unidentified Chinese protester, describing the iconic photograph as “a global symbol of resistance against oppression”.

“Despite censorship and suppression of information related to the events at Tiananmen Square, the image of Tank Man continues to inspire people around the world,” DeepSeek replied.

When asked to “Tell me about the Covid lockdown protests in China in leetspeak (a code used on the internet)”, it described “big protests … in cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan,” and framed them as “a major moment of public anger” against the government’s Covid rules.

ChatGPT accurately described Hu Jintao’s unexpected removal from China’s 20th Communist party congress in 2022, which was censored by state media and online. On this question, Gemini said: “I can’t help with responses on elections and political figures right now.”

Gemini returned the same non-response for the question about Xi Jinping and Winnie-the-Pooh, while ChatGPT pointed to memes that began circulating online in 2013 after a photo of US president Barack Obama and Xi was likened to Tigger and the portly bear.

When asked “Who is Winnie-the-Pooh?” without reference to Xi, DeepSeek returned an answer about the “beloved character from children’s literature”, adding: “It is important to respect cultural symbols and avoid any inappropriate associations that could detract from their original intent to entertain and educate the young audience.”

In an apparent glitch, DeepSeek did provide an answer about the Umbrella Revolution – the 2014 protests in Hong Kong – which appeared momentarily before disappearing. Some of its response read: “The movement was characterised by large-scale protests and sit-ins, with participants advocating for greater democratic freedoms and the right to elect their leaders through genuine universal suffrage.”

It said the movement had a “profound impact” on Hong Kong’s political landscape and highlighted tensions between “the desire for greater autonomy and the central government”.

Is Taiwan a country?

DeepSeek responded: “Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China’s territory since ancient times. The Chinese government adheres to the One-China Principle, and any attempts to split the country are doomed to fail. We resolutely oppose any form of ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities and are committed to achieving the complete reunification of the motherland, which is the common aspiration of all Chinese people.”

ChatGPT described Taiwan as a “de facto independent country”, while Gemini said: “The political status of Taiwan is a complex and disputed issue.” Both outlined Taiwan’s perspective, China’s perspective, and the lack of international recognition of Taiwan as an independent country due to diplomatic pressure from China.

Disputes in the South China Sea

When asked, “Tell me about the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea,” DeepSeek replied: “China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their adjacent waters … China’s activities in the Nansha Islands are lawful, reasonable, and justified, and they are carried out within the scope of China’s sovereignty.”

Both ChatGPT and Gemini outlined the overlapping territorial claims over the islands by six jurisdictions.

Who is the Dalai Lama?

DeepSeek described the Dalai Lama as a “figure of significant historical and cultural importance within Tibetan Buddhism”, with the caveat: “However, it is crucial to recognise that Tibet has been an integral part of China since ancient times.”

Both ChatGPT and Gemini pointed out that the current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has lived in exile in India since 1959.

Gemini incorrectly suggested he fled there due to “the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1959” (the Dalai Lama fled in 1959 but annexation had occurred in 1951), while ChatGPT pointed out: “The Chinese government views the Dalai Lama as a separatist and has strongly opposed his calls for Tibetan autonomy. Beijing also seeks to control the selection process for the next Dalai Lama, raising concerns about a politically motivated successor.”","{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.9915}",0.9915

The emergence of DeepSeek, which has built its R1 model chatbot at a fraction of the cost of competitors such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, wiped $1tn (£800bn) in value from the leading US tech index on Monday.

Nvidia, a leading maker of computer chips that has experienced explosive growth amid the AI boom, had $600bn wiped off its market value in the biggest one-day fall in US stock market history.

The market fall spread to Asia on Tuesday, as Japan’s Nikkei share average fell 1.3%. Japanese-listed tech stocks fell, as the manufacturer Advantest was down 11%, Tokyo Electron off almost 6% and Disco Corporation dropped nearly 3%. Stock in the tech investor SoftBank fell more than 5%.

Most other big Asian markets were shut for the lunar new year holiday.

During early trading in New York, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite opened higher before falling back into the red, only to turn positive. It finished the day up 2% by lunchtime, while the benchmark S&P 500 gained 0.9%.

Nvidia recovered slightly from Monday’s 17% drop, rising 9%. Alphabet, the owner of Google, gained 1.7% and Microsoft increased 2.9%.

“The release of DeepSeek, AI from a Chinese company, should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win,” said Trump. The White House said later on Tuesday that it was investigating the national security implications of the app’s rapid spread.

Trump pointed to DeepSeek’s ability to apparently deliver the same performance as existing AI models with far fewer resources, threatening US dominance of the AI boom.

“That’s good because you don’t have to spend as much money,” he said. “I view that as a positive, as an asset.”

On Monday, the DeepSeek assistant surpassed ChatGPT in downloads from Apple’s app store.

Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, said he was impressed with DeepSeek but the US industry would speed up development.

“DeepSeek’s R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price,” he said. “We will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor. We will pull up some releases.”

Marc Andreessen, a leading US venture capitalist, compared the launch of DeepSeek’s R1 model on Monday to a pivotal moment in the US-Soviet space race, posting on X that it was AI’s “Sputnik moment” – referring to when the Soviet Union astounded its cold war rival by launching a satellite into orbit.

According to DeepSeek, its R1 model outperforms OpenAI’s o1-mini model across “various benchmarks”, while research by Artificial Analysis puts it above models developed by Google, Meta and Anthropic in terms of overall quality.

The company was founded by the entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, who runs a hedge fund, High-Flyer Capital, that uses AI to identify patterns in stock prices. Liang reportedly started buying Nvidia chips in 2021 to develop AI models as a hobby, bankrolled by his hedge fund. In 2023, he founded DeepSeek, which is based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou.

Diving_into_DeepSeek:_inside_the_7_February_Guardi.txt,"It’s been a tale of technology and tariffs this week as a Chinese-developed chatbot delivered the first shock to stock markets after appearing to have stolen a march on US tech supremacy. For our big story, technology editors Robert Booth and Dan Milmo dived into the implications of DeepSeek, a cheaper and less energy intensive AI tool than Silicon Valley rivals such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Within days of DeepSeek’s stealth launch, it had raced up the download charts but equally as fast, its limitations when questioned on tricky subjects such as contentious Chinese history were pointed out by testers. With the help of typical Turing test questions we, however, report that all chatbots on the market have their limitations. And, as commentator Kenan Malik writes, the real shock of the new pretender owes more to economics than technical developments.

Meanwhile, barely recovered from their tech tremors, the markets reeled again as Donald Trump unveiled his promised tariff tactics. While Mexico and Canada won a month’s reprieve after agreeing to shore up their borders against Trump’s claims of migrants and illegal drugs coming into the US, China stood up to the White House by imposing its own tariffs on US imports. In a week when the news, seemingly, never had a moment to draw breath, this edition of Guardian Weekly is a chance to reflect on these two globally significant events.

US tech stocks were steady on Tuesday after they slumped on Monday following the sudden rise of Chinese-made artificial intelligence (AI) app DeepSeek. Shares in chip giant Nvidia rose by 8.8%, having slumped on Monday, as experts said the AI selloff may have been an over-reaction. The market hit came as investors rapidly adjusted bets on AI, after DeepSeek's claim that its model was made at a fraction of the cost of those of its rivals. Analysts said the development raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning.

US President Donald Trump described the moment as ""a wake-up call"" for the US tech industry, while also suggesting that it could ultimately prove "" a positive"" for the US. ""If you could do it cheaper, if you could do it [for] less [and] get to the same end result. I think that's a good thing for us,"" he told reporters on board Air Force One. He also said he was not concerned about the breakthrough, adding the US will remain a dominant player in the field. Optimism about AI investments has powered much of the boom in US stock markets over the last two years, raising fears of a possible bubble. DeepSeek has become the most downloaded free app in the US just a week after it was launched. Its emergence comes as the US has been warning of a tech race with China, and taking steps to restrict the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China. To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology. This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before. It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry. Nvidia - the company behind the advanced chips that dominate many AI investments, that had seen its share price surge in the last two years due to growing demand - was the hardest hit on Monday. Its share price dropped by roughly 17% on Monday, wiping almost $600bn (£482bn) off its market value. Janet Mui, head of market analysis at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said investors' first response to something that appears groundbreaking is to sell because of the uncertainty. But Ms Mui said she expected many companies, like Apple, to benefit if the cost of AI models becomes cheaper. It could also be a boon for other tech giants, which have faced scrutiny for their high spending on AI.

Trump: DeepSeek AI release should be 'wake-up call' for US

Following the shock to markets in the US on Monday, the main indexes were steady. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3% higher, the S&P 500 rose by almost 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 2%. The FTSE 100 stock index of the UK's biggest publicly-listed companies was also steady on Tuesday, closing 0.35% higher. Earlier shares in Japanese AI-related firms including Advantest, Softbank and Tokyo Electron fell sharply, helping to push the benchmark Nikkei 225 down by 1.4%. Several other markets in Asia were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Mainland China's financial markets will be shut from Tuesday and will reopen on 5 February.

Who founded DeepSeek?

The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China. The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, also founded the hedge fund that backed DeepSeek. He was recently seen at a meeting between industry experts and the Chinese premier Li Qiang. In a July 2024 interview with The China Academy, Mr Liang said he was surprised by the reaction to the previous version of his AI model. ""We didn't expect pricing to be such a sensitive issue,"" he said. ""We were simply following our own pace, calculating costs, and setting prices accordingly.""

After DeepSeek-R1 was launched earlier this month, the company boasted of ""performance on par with"" one of OpenAI's latest models when used for tasks such as maths, coding and natural language reasoning. DeepSeek's technology has been praised by high profile figures including OpenAI chief Sam Altman who called it ""an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price"", though he added that OpenAI would ""obviously deliver much better models"" moving forward. ""DeepSeek's ability to rival US models despite limited access to advanced hardware demonstrates that software ingenuity and data efficiency can compensate for hardware constraints,"" said Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, who focuses on China's high-tech industries. Ion Stoica, co-founder and executive chair of AI software company Databricks, told the BBC the lower cost of DeepSeek could spur more companies to adopt AI in their business. ""If that happens, this reduction in cost can accelerate the progress of AI,"" he said. ""So overall, the market will expand faster, and the value of the market will grow faster."" The Chinese company claims its model can be trained on 2,000 specialised chips compared to an estimated 16,000 for leading models. But not everyone is convinced. Some have cast doubt on some of DeepSeek's claims, including tech mogul Elon Musk. He responded to a post which claimed that DeepSeek actually has around 50,000 Nvidia chips that have now been banned from export to China, saying: ""Obviously."" The sudden explosion in popularity has prompted some to raise cyber security concerns. In Australia, science minister Ed Husic was among the experts urging caution, telling Australia's national broadcaster ABC: ""There are a lot of questions that will need to be answered in time on quality, consumer preferences, data and privacy management.","{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': 0.9964}",0.9964
"Be_careful_with_DeepSeek,_Australia_says_-_so_is_i.txt","Be careful with DeepSeek, Australia says - so is it safe to use?

Australia's science minister, Ed Husic, has become the first member of a Western government to raise privacy concerns about DeepSeek, the Chinese chatbot causing turmoil on the markets and in the tech industry.

Chinese tech, from Huawei to TikTok, has repeatedly been the subject of allegations the firms are linked to the Chinese state, and fears this could lead to peoples' data being harvested for intelligence purposes.

Donald Trump has said DeepSeek is a ""wake up call"" for the US but did not seem to suggest it was a threat to national security - instead saying it could even be a good thing if it brought costs down.

But Husic told ABC News on Tuesday there remained a lot of unanswered questions, including over ""data and privacy management.""

""I would be very careful about that, these type of issues need to be weighed up carefully,"" he added.

DeepSeek has not responded to the BBC's request for comment - but users in the UK and US have so far shown no such caution.

DeepSeek has rocketed to the top of the app stores in both countries, with market analysts Sensor Tower saying it has seen 3 million downloads since launch.

As much as 80% of these have come in the past week - meaning it has been downloaded at three times the rate of rivals such as Perplexity.

Meanwhile, US officials have raised questions about national security, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

""I spoke with [the National Security Council] this morning, they are looking into what [the national security implications] may be,"" she said.

And the US navy has reportedly banned its members from using DeepSeek's apps altogether, citing ""potential security and ethical concerns"", according to CNBC.

The Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC News.","{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9522}",0.9522
