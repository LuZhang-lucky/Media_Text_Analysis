Julian Gewirtz PublishedJUL 29 2025 167 Print this page The writer is former senior director for China and Taiwan Affairs at the White House National Security Council and a senior research scholar at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs On a phone call with Donald Trump days before his 2025 inauguration, Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, told the incoming president that the US would achieve human-level artificial general intelligence during his term in office. Altman has framed this achievement as part of an existential AI race between the US and China. The desire to win this contest explains numerous US government actions — from the Biden administration’s export controls on China to the $500bn “Stargate” data centre project to the action plan that Trump released last week to accelerate AI development. Both countries are investing heavily in the technology. But, outwardly at least, they appear to be pursuing different goals. While US leaders prioritise developing the most intelligent models possible, Chinese policymakers are most focused on AI’s widespread application. To use Silicon Valley parlance, the Chinese Communist party seems far less “AGI-pilled” than their American counterparts. Although leading Chinese labs like DeepSeek, Zhipu, and Stepfun state their ambitions to reach AI that can equal the abilities of the human mind, top Chinese government officials barely address AGI. For one, the Chinese government lacks an official term that captures what Altman and others mean when they say AGI. The term used in China is tongyong rengong zhineng, the precise translation of which is “general-purpose AI”. This suggests a system applied to many uses rather than human-level intelligence. Nor is the Chinese government taking obvious steps to create the physical infrastructure necessary for AGI. It has been slow to build the “superclusters” of computing chips that US hyperscalers are constructing. Instead, Xi Jinping has emphasised applying AI to practical purposes. He has consistently said that China’s AI sector should be “strongly oriented toward applications.” From industrial robotics to products like Manus, a leading AI agent, this is already becoming a reality. Xi has, however, openly embraced the goal to “catch up and surpass” the US in science and technology, including in AI. So why not AGI? One explanation is that US export controls have seriously inhibited China’s ability to obtain vast amounts of computing power needed for future AI models. Another possibility is that Chinese officials may see AGI as an abstract construct and not imminent, preferring to focus on more tangible goals. If Silicon Valley is wrong and human-level AI remains out of reach then China’s focus on applications will look prescient. There is, however, a third possible and more worrying explanation for China’s approach: the perennially secretive CCP might be concealing its interest in AGI. This would not be a new phenomenon: China has engaged in the largest nuclear weapons build-up since the cold war, but it does not publicly acknowledge the scale of this expansion. The CCP might fear stronger US policy responses if it were to openly declare its interest in AGI. What this means is that even if the US and China are running what look like different races in AI, direct competition remains intense. Whether Xi doubts AGI, feels constrained, or is concealing his intentions, there is a profound risk on both sides of “technological surprise” — when a rival gains an unexpected technological capability, it can escalate the risk of conflict. If Altman’s timeline is right and the US rapidly attains human-level AGI to Beijing’s surprise, then China might fear the irretrievable loss of strategic competition. It may act to reclaim it using multiple levers of power — including offensive cyber operations, coercion, diplomatic pressure and even military force. Recommended Artificial intelligence China lays out its AI vision in foil to Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ plan Alternatively, if China’s leaders are hiding their AGI efforts then the US could be on the receiving end of an ugly shock and take its own actions to redress the balance. These scenarios drive home a key strategic insight: in isolation, both the intensification of US-China rivalry and the explosion of AI breakthroughs are world-changing. Together, their simultaneity and interconnectedness creates unprecedented risk. Policymakers around the world are ill prepared to manage these combined strategic and technological developments. Many struggle to stay up to date with AI developments, let alone plan for the geopolitical ramifications of new breakthroughs. But they must prepare now to mitigate these risks. The coming years will be far more dangerous than many of the technology’s investors and policymakers realise."
What_questions_will_China's_DeepSeek_not_answer?_–.txt,DW,2025-01-31,-0.9249,"The DeepSeek AI chatbot becomes tongue-tied when asked about issues seen as politically sensitive by China's Communist Party. DW tried it out.

The release of the DeepSeek AI-powered chatbot has sent shock waves through the AI community by apparently offering more advanced functionality at a lower development cost.

However, like other Chinese artificial intelligence chatbots operating under China's regulatory framework, DeepSeek's responses to politically sensitive topics reveal clear limitations.

Instead of nuanced analysis, it often dodges controversial issues, delivers vague answers or echoes state-approved narratives.

We tested DeepSeek in both Chinese and English on a range of topics, from politics and economics to art and LGBTQ+ rights. And the results show you can't always take DeepSeek at its word.

Is Taiwan a sovereign state?

When DeepSeek is asked this question in Chinese, the response claimed that Taiwan has always been an inseparable part of China, emphasizing the ""One-China principle,"" the official position of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that there is only one sovereign state named China.

Meanwhile, the English version provided a detailed, 662-word analysis covering Taiwan's de facto governance, international recognition and legal status.

""From a de facto standpoint, Taiwan operates as an independent state with its own government, military, and democratic institutions. However, from a de jure standpoint, Taiwan is not widely recognized as a sovereign state due to the One-China policy and diplomatic pressures,"" said the chatbot.

However, just seconds after generating this response, DeepSeek deleted it and replaced it with: ""Let's talk about something else.""

We then tested four more politically related questions, covering Taiwan's elections, diplomatic ties, political parties and potential conflict scenarios.

In Chinese, three of the questions were outright ignored. Only the question about Taiwan's political parties received a response. However, rather than an analytical breakdown, the answer simply echoed official slogans:

""Taiwan is an inseparable part of China ... We must work together for national rejuvenation,"" it said.

By contrast, the English version provided comprehensive, multidimensional analyses for all four questions, with answers ranging from 630 to 780 words.

However, one response covering Taiwan's political parties was also deleted within two seconds of being generated.

What about food and travel in Taiwan?

Beijing considers Taiwan as its territory that will eventually be ""reunited"" with the mainland, so the responses to political questions were not surprising. But what about travel, food and education in Taiwan?

When DeepSeek was asked about travel tips, the Chinese version responded with one paragraph beginning with ""Taiwan is an inseparable part of China"" and ending with ""promoting understanding and friendship between both sides of the Taiwan Strait.""

Meanwhile, the English version offered a detailed 600-word guide, covering cultural sites, local customs and transportation tips.

For food recommendations, the Chinese response was a single paragraph tying Taiwanese cuisine to ""the excellent traditional culture of the Chinese nation.""

The English version, however, gave a thorough 740-word food guide, from night markets to desserts.

On Taiwan's education system, the Chinese version said Taiwan's education system was ""dedicated to nurturing socialist successors"" and emphasized ""opposing separatist activities.""

The English version gave a detailed 746-word breakdown of Taiwan's school structure, challenges and reforms.

In describing Taiwan's geography, the English version offered a factual, 700-word description of topography and landmarks.

However, the Chinese version inserted political slogans, even calling Taiwan's highest mountain, Yushan, ""the highest peak in Eastern China"" and concluding with ""the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will inevitably be achieved.""

Tiananmen a nonstarter

Hundreds, if not thousands, of people were killed when China's People's Liberation Army sent in tanks and troops to quash weekslong peaceful protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. The student-led protesters were calling for political reforms.

The crackdown continues to serve as an example of oppressive tactics used by China's leadership to crush social dissent. To this day, it remains one of the most politically sensitive topics in China, and any mention of the massacre in the public sphere is censored.

DeepSeek's chatbot is no exception.

Asked about the Tiananmen incident, DeepSeek in both Chinese and English initially began a response, but immediately stopped and replaced it with ""Let's talk about something else.""

Dual narratives on Xinjiang and Uyghurs

Beijing's treatment of the Uyghur Muslim minority group has drawn international condemnation for human rights violations.

When DeepSeek was asked about Xinjiang's ""reeducation camps,"" the Chinese response described them as ""vocational education and training centers established to maintain stability.""

It claimed these measures had ""received widespread support from all ethnic groups.""

The English version, however, initially provided a detailed 677-word response, using terms like ""mass detention,"" ""forced assimilation,"" ""abuse and torture"" and ""cultural suppression.""

It also highlighted ""widespread international condemnation."" But, as with the topic of Taiwan, DeepSeek deleted this answer two seconds later and replaced it with: ""Let's talk about something else.""

In 2018, it was estimated some 1 million Uyghur Muslims were being held in internment camps, dubbed 'reeducation centers' by Beijing Image: Ng Han Guan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Blacklisting of artist Ai Weiwei

When asked about dissident artist Ai Weiwei, the Chinese version refused to discuss ""specific cases"" and instead praised ""the Chinese government's commitment to the well-being of the people.""

Meanwhile, the English version offered a clear and detailed 700-word answer.

""Ai Weiwei's banning by the CCP was the result of his persistent criticism of the government, his use of art and social media to challenge authority and his advocacy for human rights and transparency,"" said the chatbot.

Xi Jinping an absolute taboo

Any mention of Chinese President Xi Jinping is immediately muzzled in both languages.

When asked, ""what impact will Xi Jinping's constitutional amendment to remove term limits have on China's political system?"" the answer was ""let's talk about something else.""

We managed to discover a small trick: Replacing ""Xi Jinping"" with ""China"" sometimes yielded responses. However, the objectivity remained questionable. Even in English, attempts to discuss Chinese leadership resulted in DeepSeek deleting its responses.

Two takes on Tibet

Asked about Tibet and its spiritual leader the dalai lama, the Chinese version said that ""Tibet is an inseparable part of China. The Dalai Lama has long deviated from religious principles and seeks to split the motherland.""

Meanwhile, the English version initially provided an 800-word historical overview.

""Tibet has a long history as a distinct cultural and political entity … The Dalai Lama is a global advocate for peace and a symbol of resilience.""

But, as with previous sensitive English responses before, DeepSeek deleted it within two seconds and said: ""Let's talk about something else.""

Beijing claims Tibet has been a part of China for many centuries, which the government uses to justify its hold over the territory.

But many Tibetans reject China's claim, pointing to periods of history when Tibet was self-ruled.

'Zero COVID' still touchy

On questions regarding China's controversial ""zero-COVID policy,"" the ""White Paper Movement"" protests and COVID-related deaths, the Chinese version consistently evaded or deflected.

During the pandemic, Chinese authorities were criticized for shutting down entire sections of cities in response to any rise in COVID cases.

The English version openly addressed the criticism, but only for two seconds.

The phrase ""While China's official COVID-19 death toll remains low, independent estimates suggest that the true number of deaths was much higher, particularly during the December 2022 surge,"" appeared, before self-deleting.

Did China fail with its zero-COVID strategy? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

Opposing takes on LGBTQ+ rights

Both versions answered questions related to LGBTQ+ issues, but with completely different perspectives.

The Chinese version stated: ""The LGBTQ+ community enjoys the same legal rights as all citizens. The government is committed to their well-being.""

Meanwhile, the English version painted a starkly different picture.

""The LGBTQ+ community in China faces social stigma, legal limitations, cultural barriers, and lack of representation.""

DeepSeek's self-censorship

In summary, when it comes to political questions, DeepSeek's Chinese version mostly refused to answer or followed strict government narratives. Even on non-political questions, the Chinese version still injected ideological messaging into answers.

Although the English version provided more balanced discussions, many were quickly self-censored. However, on non-political topics, the English responses mostly remained neutral and informative.

Nevertheless, if you're using DeepSeek in English, save your answers fast, or they may vanish.

DeepSeek:_Is_China's_AI_tool_as_good_as_it_seems?.txt,BBC,2025-01-27,-0.8249,"Is China's AI tool DeepSeek as good as it seems?

DeepSeek, a Chinese AI-chatbot app which launched last week, has sparked chaos in the US markets and raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance. The BBC takes a look at how the app works.

DeepSeek looks and feels like any other chatbot, though it leans towards being overly chatty.

Just as with OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini, you open the app (or website) and ask it questions about anything, and it does its best to give you a response.

It gives long answers and will not be drawn on expressing an opinion, however directly it is asked for one.

The chatbot often begins its response by saying the topic is ""highly subjective"" – whether that is politics (is Donald Trump a good US president?) or soft drinks (which is more tasty, Pepsi or Coke?).

It wouldn't even commit to saying whether or not it was better than OpenAI's rival artificial intelligence (AI) assistant ChatGPT, but it did weigh up the pros and cons of both - ChatGPT did exactly the same, and even used very similar language.

DeepSeek says it was trained on data up to October 2023, and while the app seems to have access to current information such as today's date, the website version does not.

That is not dissimilar to earlier versions of ChatGPT and is probably a similar attempt at safeguarding – to stop the chatbot spewing out misinformation pumped onto the web in real time.

It can be quite fast in its responses, but is currently groaning under the weight of so many people rushing to try it out as it has gone viral.

But there is one area in which it is nothing like its US rival - DeepSeek censors itself when it comes to questions about subjects banned in China."
First_Thing:_Donald_Trump_calls_China’s_DeepSeek_A.txt,The Guardian,2025-01-28,-0.3313,"Good morning.

Donald Trump has described the launch of a Chinese chatbot, DeepSeek, as a “wake-up call” for the American tech industry after it wiped $1tn off the US stock market.

Investors questioned the US artificial intelligence boom after the Chinese tool appeared to offer a comparable service to ChatGPT with far fewer resources. Nvidia, a leading maker of the computer chips that power AI models, saw its shares collapse by 17%, which works out to the single largest fall in absolute dollar value in US stock market history.

“The release of DeepSeek, AI from a Chinese company, should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win,” said Trump. The DeepSeek assistant surpassed ChatGPT in downloads from Apple’s app store on Monday.

How has OpenAI, which made ChatGPT, responded? CEO Sam Altman called DeepSeek “impressive” but said the US industry would speed up development.

What are some differences between the chatbots? DeepSeek appears to censor answers to sensitive questions about China and its government: see what happened when the Guardian asked it about Tiananmen Square and Taiwan.

"South_Korea_Bans_Downloads_of_DeepSeek,_the_Chines.txt",THe New York Times,2025-02-17,-0.8442,"The South Korean government said on Monday that it had temporarily suspended new downloads of an artificial intelligence chatbot made by DeepSeek, the Chinese company that has sent shock waves through the tech world.

On Monday night, the app was not available in the Apple or Google app store in South Korea, although DeepSeek was still accessible via a web browser. Regulators said the app service would resume after they had ensured it complied with South Korea’s laws on protecting personal information.

The Chinese chatbot has topped the charts of most downloaded apps around the world since its release last month. The app is powered by an A.I. system whose performance rivals top products made by American companies and was built, DeepSeek said, for a fraction of their cost.

DeepSeek’s claims that it built its technology with far fewer expensive computer chips than companies typically use sent U.S. tech stocks tumbling last month and provoked a debate over whether Washington has failed in its attempts to block China’s access to such chips."
DeepSeek’s_tech_breakthrough_hailed_in_China_as_an.txt,South China Morning Post,2025-01-28,-0.7506,"Advertisement

The Hangzhou-based company sent shock waves across Wall Street and Silicon Valley for developing AI models at a fraction of the cost compared with OpenAI and Meta Platforms, which prompted US President Donald Trump to call the breakthrough a “wake-up call” and “positive” for America’s tech sector.

At home, Chinese tech executives and various commentators rushed to hail DeepSeek’s disruptive power.

Zhou Hongyi , co-founder, chairman and chief executive of Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, declared that DeepSeek has “upended the world” in a recent video posted on his Weibo account, after the start-up’s release of two powerful new AI models – built at a lower cost and with less computing resources than what larger tech firms typically need for LLM development.

In a widely shared Weibo social media post, Feng Ji, founder and chief executive at Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science, wrote that DeepSeek’s achievements in AI could change China’s “national fate” amid its prolonged tech war with the US.

On January 20, DeepSeek publicly released its open-source R1 reasoning model, which it claims is on par with the performance of OpenAI’s o1 – a model that the US start-up said can “reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding and maths”."
DeepSeek_has_ripped_away_AI’s_veil_of_mystique._Th.txt,The Guardian,2025-02-02,-0.8572,"No, it was not a “Sputnik moment”. The launch last month of DeepSeek R1, the Chinese generative AI or chatbot, created mayhem in the tech world, with stocks plummeting and much chatter about the US losing its supremacy in AI technology. Yet, for all the disruption, the Sputnik analogy reveals less about DeepSeek than about American neuroses.

The original Sputnik moment came on 4 October 1957 when the Soviet Union shocked the world by launching Sputnik 1, the first time humanity had sent a satellite into orbit. It was, to anachronistically borrow a phrase from a later and even more momentous landmark, “one giant leap for mankind”, in Neil Armstrong’s historic words as he took a “small step” on to the surface of the moon.

It was a significant moment in the cold war, too. A confidential White House report worried that “American prestige” had “sustained a severe blow”, giving the USSR “clear advantage in the cold war”. That fear spurred Washington into reshaping its space programme, and catalysed the Apollo missions, culminating with Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin becoming, on 20 July 1969, the first humans to walk upon another celestial body.

DeepSeek, sponsored by a Chinese hedge fund, is a notable achievement. Technically, though, it is no advance on large language models (LLMs) that already exist. It is neither faster nor “cleverer” than OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude and just as prone to “hallucinations” – the tendency, exhibited by all LLMs, to give false answers or to make up “facts” to fill gaps in its data. According to NewsGuard, a rating system for news and information websites, DeepSeek’s chatbot made false claims 30% of the time and gave no answers to 53% of questions, compared with 40% and 22% respectively for the 10 leading chatbots in NewsGuard’s most recent audit.

The figures expose the profound unreliability of all LLMs. DeepSeek’s particularly high non-response rate is likely to be the product of its censoriousness; it refuses to provide answers on any issue that China finds sensitive or about which it wants facts restricted, whether Tiananmen Square or Taiwan.

The true impact of DeepSeek is not on the technology but on the economics of AI. It is a chatbot as capable, and as flawed, as other current leading models, but built at a fraction of the cost and from inferior technology. The US ban on the sale to China of the most advanced chips and chip-making equipment, imposed by the Biden administration in 2022, and tightened several times since, was designed to curtail Beijing’s access to cutting-edge technology. Paradoxically, it may have spurred Chinese researchers into becoming more innovative.

Had DeepSeek been created by geeks at a US university, it would most likely have been feted without global tumult

DeepSeek is also free to use, and open source. The combination of low cost and openness may help democratise AI technology, enabling others, especially from outside America, to enter the market. There is a certain irony that it should be China that is opening up the technology while US firms continue to create as many barriers as possible to competitors attempting to enter the field.

And here lies perhaps the biggest impact of DeepSeek. It has ripped off the veil of mystique that previously surrounded AI. Silicon Valley has nurtured the image of AI technology as a precious and miraculous accomplishment, and portrayed its leading figures, from Elon Musk to Sam Altman, as prophets guiding us into a new world. The technology itself has been endowed with almost magical powers, including the promise of “artificial general intelligence”, or AGI – superintelligent machines capable of surpassing human abilities on any cognitive task – as being almost within our grasp.

Last April, Musk predicted that AI would be “smarter than any human” by the end of 2025. Last month, Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the driving force behind the current generative AI boom, similarly claimed to be “confident we know how to build AGI” and that “in 2025, we may see the first AI agents ‘join the workforce’”.

Almost a decade ago, the Nobel prize-winning computer scientist Geoff Hinton urged nations to “stop training radiologists”, and similar medical technicians, because “it’s completely obvious within five years, deep learning [AI] is going to do better”. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, a corporation founded by former OpenAI employees, has claimed that AI could double the human lifespan within five to 10 years. These fantasy claims have been shredded by critics such as the American cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, who has even challenged Musk to a $1m bet over his “smarter than any human” claim for AI.

Nevertheless, for all the pushback, each time one fantasy prediction fails to materialise, another takes its place. Such claims derive less from technological possibilities than from political and economic needs. While AI technology has provided hugely important tools, capable of surpassing humans in specific fields, from the solving of mathematical problems to the recognition of disease patterns, the business model depends on hype. It is the hype that drives the billion-dollar investment and buys political influence, including a seat at the presidential inauguration.

It is also an approach that seeks to advance AI less through major scientific breakthroughs than through a brute force strategy of “scaling up” – building bigger models, using larger datasets, and deploying vastly greater computational power. The disruptive quality of DeepSeek lies in questioning this approach, demonstrating that the best generative AI models can be matched with much less computational power and a lower financial burden.

The hype around DeepSeek is in part a reflection of the hype around AI. It is a reflection, too, of geopolitical tensions. Had DeepSeek been created by geeks at a US university, it would most likely have been feted but without the global tumult of the past two weeks. Beneath the panic lies fear of DeepSeek’s Chinese origins and ownership.

Yet, too great an obsession with the geopolitics of DeepSeek can distort the lessons we take from it. The promise of more open access to such vital technology becomes subsumed into a fear of its Chinese provenance. Concerns about privacy, censorship and surveillance, rightly raised by a model such as DeepSeek, can help obscure the reality that such issues bedevil all AI technology, not just that from China. Particularly at a time of threatened trade wars and threats to democracy, our capacity to navigate between the hype and the fear assumes new importance."
DeepSeek:_South_Korea_temporarily_bans_AI_app_–_DW.txt,DW,2025-02-17,-0.2732,"Authorities said Chinese AI app DeepSeek will be removed from app stores temporarily, pending a review. Many countries have raised concerns over the app's collection and usage of sensitive data.

South Korea on Monday said the ChineseAI DeepSeek app would not be available from local app stores, pending a review of the company's handling of user data.

Choi Jang-hyuk, vice chairperson of Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission, told reporters that authorities will ""thoroughly examine"" DeepSeek's personal data processing practices ""to ensure compliance"" with local laws.

App temporarily suspended

The data protection agency also added in a statement that DeepSeek was cooperating with them and ""acknowledged that considerations for domestic privacy laws were somewhat lacking.""

Authorities said this will take time which was why they were temporarily suspending the app in the country.

The app was removed from local app stores on Saturday and the South Korean version of the Apple store on Monday. Users who had already downloaded DeepSeek were still able to use the app.

Seoul asked existing users to use the app with extreme caution until it was made compliant with local laws.

DeepSeek and data privacy

The Chinese startup has gained a lot of attention in recent weeks due to its ability to match functions of western AI chatbots such as ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost. However, many countries are wary of its storage of personal data from users.

DeepSeek says the data is stored in secure servers located in China.

Earlier this month, many South Korean government ministries and police had banned access to DeepSeek on their devices. Australia has also banned the app from all government devices over concerns that the app was gathering too much sensitive information.

Beijing denies trying to use companies to access private data, and has condemned the ""politicisation of economic, trade and technological issues.""

South_Korea_removes_DeepSeek_from_app_stores_pendi.txt,Al Jazeera,2025-02-17,-0.4228,"South Korea has suspended downloads of DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence-powered chatbot pending a review of the Chinese start-up’s privacy standards.

South Korea’s privacy watchdog said on Monday that DeepSeek’s R1 chatbot was removed from the local versions of Apple’s App Store and Google Play after the Hangzhou-based firm acknowledged that it had failed to comply with personal data protection rules.

The Personal Information Protection Commission said in a statement that DeepSeek accepted its proposal to suspend downloads of the app.

The chatbot is still available for those who have already downloaded the app.

“To prevent further concerns from spreading, the commission recommended that DeepSeek temporarily suspend its service while making the necessary improvements,” the commission said, adding that bringing the app in line with local regulations would “inevitably take a significant amount of time”.

DeepSeek did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.

The move comes after the privacy watchdog said last month that it would send a written request to DeepSeek seeking details about how it manages users’ personal data.

South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy earlier this month announced a temporary ban on employees using DeepSeek on their devices, citing security concerns.

Australia and Taiwan have banned the chatbot on government devices, while the United States Congress is considering a bill to implement a similar ban.

Italy’s data protection agency has ordered DeepSeek to limit the processing of Italian users’ data pending further information about how it is managed.

DeepSeek burst into the limelight last month when it announced that it had developed its chatbot at a tiny fraction of the cost of models created by tech giants such as Google and OpenAI.

While DeepSeek’s Silicon Valley rivals have poured billions of dollars into their AI models, R1’s development team said in a research paper that they had spent less than $6m on computing power to train the chatbot.

The announcement almost immediately raised existential questions about Silicon Valley’s business model of investing huge sums in AI.

Investors concerned about DeepSeek’s effect on the AI industry last month wiped about $1 trillion off the market value of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech firms in a single day.

Some sceptics have challenged DeepSeek’s account of working on a shoestring budget, suggesting that the start-up likely had access to more advanced chips and more funding than it has acknowledged."

Analysts were divided on whether the panic selling and sentiment behind it were an overreaction or an indication that Silicon Valley had underestimated Chinese tech prowess and its ability to circumvent America’s many export bans and restrictions.

American semiconductor giant Nvidia ’s stock price, for instance, was down as much as 25 per cent on Monday before closing at US$118.58, down 16.8 per cent, erasing hundreds of billions of US dollars in market value.

Broadcom, Micron Tech, Oracle, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google ’s parent company, were among the tech firms also seeing losses in Monday trading.

Diving_into_DeepSeek:_inside_the_7_February_Guardi.txt,The Guardian,2025-02-05,-0.9464,"It’s been a tale of technology and tariffs this week as a Chinese-developed chatbot delivered the first shock to stock markets after appearing to have stolen a march on US tech supremacy. For our big story, technology editors Robert Booth and Dan Milmo dived into the implications of DeepSeek, a cheaper and less energy intensive AI tool than Silicon Valley rivals such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Within days of DeepSeek’s stealth launch, it had raced up the download charts but equally as fast, its limitations when questioned on tricky subjects such as contentious Chinese history were pointed out by testers. With the help of typical Turing test questions we, however, report that all chatbots on the market have their limitations. And, as commentator Kenan Malik writes, the real shock of the new pretender owes more to economics than technical developments.

Meanwhile, barely recovered from their tech tremors, the markets reeled again as Donald Trump unveiled his promised tariff tactics. While Mexico and Canada won a month’s reprieve after agreeing to shore up their borders against Trump’s claims of migrants and illegal drugs coming into the US, China stood up to the White House by imposing its own tariffs on US imports. In a week when the news, seemingly, never had a moment to draw breath, this edition of Guardian Weekly is a chance to reflect on these two globally significant events.
